# Valibot

The modular and type safe schema library for validating structural data.

## Get started (guides)

### Introduction

Hello, I am Valibot and I would like to help you validate data easily using a schema. No matter if it is incoming data on a server, a form or even configuration files. I have no dependencies and can run in any JavaScript environment.

> I highly recommend you read the [announcement post](https://www.builder.io/blog/introducing-valibot), and if you are a nerd like me, the [bachelor's thesis](/thesis.pdf) I am based on.

#### Highlights

- Fully type safe with static type inference
- Small bundle size starting at less than 700 bytes
- Validate everything from strings to complex objects
- Open source and fully tested with 100 % coverage
- Many transformation and validation actions included
- Well structured source code without dependencies
- Minimal, readable and well thought out API

#### Example

First you create a schema that describes a structured data set. A schema can be compared to a type definition in TypeScript. The big difference is that TypeScript types are "not executed" and are more or less a DX feature. A schema on the other hand, apart from the inferred type definition, can also be executed at runtime to guarantee type safety of unknown data.

{/_ prettier-ignore _/}

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

// 1.31 kB

// Create login schema with email and password
const LoginSchema = v.object({
  email: v.pipe(v.string(), v.email()),
  password: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(8)),
});

// Infer output TypeScript type of login schema as
// { email: string; password: string }
type LoginData = v.InferOutput<typeof LoginSchema>;

// Throws error for email and password
const output1 = v.parse(LoginSchema, { email: "", password: "" });

// Returns data as { email: string; password: string }
const output2 = v.parse(LoginSchema, {
  email: "jane@example.com",
  password: "12345678",
});
```

Apart from <Link href="/api/parse/">`parse`</Link> I also offer a non-exception-based API with <Link href="/api/safeParse/">`safeParse`</Link> and a type guard function with <Link href="/api/is/">`is`</Link>. You can read more about it <Link href="/guides/parse-data/">here</Link>.

#### Comparison

Instead of relying on a few large functions with many methods, my API design and source code is based on many small and independent functions, each with just a single task. This modular design has several advantages.

For example, this allows a bundler to use the import statements to remove code that is not needed. This way, only the code that is actually used gets into your production build. This can reduce the bundle size by up to 95 % compared to [Zod](https://zod.dev/).

In addition, it allows you to easily extend my functionality with external code and makes my source code more robust and secure because the functionality of the individual functions can be tested much more easily through unit tests.

#### Credits

My friend [Fabian](https://github.com/fabian-hiller) created me as part of his bachelor thesis at [Stuttgart Media University](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/en/), supervised by Walter Kriha, [Miško Hevery](https://github.com/mhevery) and [Ryan Carniato](https://github.com/ryansolid). My role models also include [Colin McDonnell](https://github.com/colinhacks), who had a big influence on my API design with [Zod](https://zod.dev/).

#### License

I am completely free and licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/blob/main/LICENSE.md). But if you like, you can feed me with a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot).

### Installation

Valibot is currently available for Node, Bun and Deno. Below you will learn how to add the library to your project.

#### General

Except for this guide, the rest of this documentation assumes that you are using npm for the import statements in the code examples.

It should make no difference whether you use individual imports or a wildcard import. Tree shaking and code splitting should work in both cases.

If you are using TypeScript, we recommend that you enable strict mode in your `tsconfig.json` so that all types are calculated correctly.

> The minimum required TypeScript version is v5.0.2.

```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    // ...
  }
}
```

#### From npm

For Node and Bun, you can add the library to your project with a single command using your favorite package manager.

```bash
npm install valibot     # npm
yarn add valibot        # yarn
pnpm add valibot        # pnpm
bun add valibot         # bun
```

Then you can import it into any JavaScript or TypeScript file.

```ts
// With individual imports
import { … } from 'valibot';

// With a wildcard import
import * as v from 'valibot';
```

#### From JSR

For Node, Deno and Bun, you can add the library to your project with a single command using your favorite package manager.

```bash
deno add jsr:@valibot/valibot      # deno
npx jsr add @valibot/valibot       # npm
yarn dlx jsr add @valibot/valibot  # yarn
pnpm dlx jsr add @valibot/valibot  # pnpm
bunx jsr add @valibot/valibot      # bun
```

Then you can import it into any JavaScript or TypeScript file.

```ts
// With individual imports
import { … } from '@valibot/valibot';

// With a wildcard import
import * as v from '@valibot/valibot';
```

In Deno, you can also directly reference me using `jsr:` specifiers.

```ts
// With individual imports
import { … } from 'jsr:@valibot/valibot';

// With a wildcard import
import * as v from 'jsr:@valibot/valibot';
```

#### From Deno

With Deno, you can reference the library directly through our deno.land/x URL.

```ts
// With individual imports
import { … } from 'https://deno.land/x/valibot/mod.ts';

// With a wildcard import
import * as v from 'https://deno.land/x/valibot/mod.ts';
```

### Quick start

A Valibot schema can be compared to a type definition in TypeScript. The big difference is that TypeScript types are "not executed" and are more or less a DX feature. A schema on the other hand, apart from the inferred type definition, can also be executed at runtime to truly guarantee type safety of unknown data.

#### Basic concept

Similar to how types can be defined in TypeScript, Valibot allows you to define a schema with various small functions. This applies to primitive values like strings as well as more complex data sets like objects.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

// TypeScript
type LoginData = {
  email: string;
  password: string;
};

// Valibot
const LoginSchema = v.object({
  email: v.string(),
  password: v.string(),
});
```

#### Pipelines

In addition, pipelines enable you to perform more detailed validations and transformations with the <Link href="/api/pipe/">`pipe`</Link> method. Thus, for example, it can be ensured that a string is an email that ends with a certain domain.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const EmailSchema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.email(), v.endsWith("@example.com"));
```

A pipeline must always start with a schema, followed by up to 19 validation or transformation actions. They are executed in sequence, and the result of the previous action is passed to the next. More details about pipelines can be found in <Link href="/guides/pipelines/">this guide</Link>.

#### Error messages

If an issue is detected during validation, the library emits a specific issue object that includes various details and an error message. This error message can be overridden via the first optional argument of a schema or validation action.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const LoginSchema = v.object({
  email: v.pipe(
    v.string("Your email must be a string."),
    v.nonEmpty("Please enter your email."),
    v.email("The email address is badly formatted.")
  ),
  password: v.pipe(
    v.string("Your password must be a string."),
    v.nonEmpty("Please enter your password."),
    v.minLength(8, "Your password must have 8 characters or more.")
  ),
});
```

Custom error messages allow you to improve the usability of your software by providing specific troubleshooting information and returning error messages in a language other than English. See the <Link href="/guides/internationalization/">i18n guide</Link> for more information.

#### Usage

Finally, you can use your schema to infer its input and output types and to parse unknown data. This way, your schema is the single source of truth. This concept simplifies your development process and makes your code more robust in the long run.

```ts
import * as v from 'valibot';

const LoginSchema = v.object({…});

type LoginData = v.InferOutput<typeof LoginSchema>;

function getLoginData(data: unknown): LoginData {
  return v.parse(LoginSchema, data);
}
```

### Use cases

Next, we would like to point out some use cases for which Valibot is particularly well suited. We welcome [ideas](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/issues/new) for other use cases that we may not have thought of yet.

#### Server requests

Since most API endpoints can be reached via the Internet, basically anyone can send a request and transmit data. It is therefore important to apply zero trust security and to check request data thoroughly before processing it further.

This works particularly well with a schema, compared to if/else conditions, as even complex structures can be easily mapped. In addition, the library automatically type the parsed data according to the schema, which improves type safety and thus makes your code more secure.

#### Form validation

A schema can also be used for form validation. Due to Valibot's small bundle size and the possibility to individualize the error messages, the library is particularly well suited for this. Also, fullstack frameworks like Next.js, Remix, and Nuxt allow the same schema to be used for validation in the browser as well as on the server, which reduces your code to the minimum.

[Modular Forms](https://modularforms.dev/react/guides/validate-your-fields#schema-validation), for example, offers validation based on a schema at form and field level. In addition, the form can be made type-safe using the schema, which also enables autocompletion during development. In combination with the right framework, a fully type-safe and progressively enhanced form can be created with few lines of code and a great experience for developers and end-users.

#### Browser state

The browser state, which is stored using cookies, search parameters or the local storage, can be accidentally or intentionally manipulated by the user. To ensure the functionality of an application, it can help to validate this data before processing. Valibot can be used for this, which also improves type safety.

#### Config files

Library authors can also make use of Valibot, for example, to match configuration files with a schema and, in the event of an error, provide clear indications of the cause and how to fix the problem. The same applies to environment variables to quickly detect configuration errors.

#### Schema builder

Our schemas are plain JavaScript objects with a well-defined and fully type-safe structure. This makes Valibot a great choice for defining data structures that can be further processed by third-party code. For example, it is possible to build an ORM with custom metadata actions on top of Valibot to generate database schemas. Another example is our official `toJsonSchema` function, which uses Valibot's object API to output a JSON Schema that can be used for documentation purposes or to generate structured output with LLMs.

#### Data migration

Valibot can also be used to migrate data from one form to another in a type-safe way. The advantage of a schema library like Valibot is that transformations can be defined for individual properties instead of for the entire dataset. This can make data migrations more readable and maintainable. In addition, the schema can be used to validate the data before the migration, which increases the reliability of the migration process.

### Comparison

Even though Valibot's API resembles other solutions at first glance, the implementation and structure of the source code is very different. In the following, we would like to highlight the differences that can be beneficial for both you and your users.

#### Modular design

Instead of relying on a few large functions with many methods, Valibot's API design and source code is based on many small and independent functions, each with just a single task. This modular design has several advantages.

On one hand, the functionality of Valibot can be easily extended with external code. On the other, it makes the source code more robust and secure because the functionality of the individual functions as well as special edge cases can be tested much easier through unit tests.

However, perhaps the biggest advantage is that a bundler can use the static import statements to remove any code that is not needed. Thus, only the code that is actually used ends up in the production build. This allows us to extend the functionality of the library with additional functions without increasing the bundle size for all users.

This can make a big difference, especially for client-side validation, as it reduces the bundle size and, depending on the framework, speeds up the startup time.

{/_ prettier-ignore _/}

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

// 1.37 kB

const LoginSchema = v.object({
  email: v.pipe(
    v.string(),
    v.nonEmpty("Please enter your email."),
    v.email("The email address is badly formatted.")
  ),
  password: v.pipe(
    v.string(),
    v.nonEmpty("Please enter your password."),
    v.minLength(8, "Your password must have 8 characters or more.")
  ),
});
```

##### Comparison with Zod

For example, to validate a simple login form, [Zod](https://zod.dev/) requires [13.5 kB](https://bundlejs.com/?q=zod&treeshake=%5B%7B+object%2Cstring+%7D%5D) whereas Valibot require only [1.37 kB](https://bundlejs.com/?q=valibot&treeshake=%5B%7B+email%2CminLength%2CnonEmpty%2Cobject%2Cstring%2Cpipe+%7D%5D). That's a 90 % reduction in bundle size. This is due to the fact that Zod's functions have several methods with additional functionalities, that cannot be easily removed by current bundlers when they are not executed in your source code.

{/_ prettier-ignore _/}

```ts
import { object, string } from "zod";

// 13.5 kB

const LoginSchema = object({
  email: string()
    .min(1, "Please enter your email.")
    .email("The email address is badly formatted."),
  password: string()
    .min(1, "Please enter your password.")
    .min(8, "Your password must have 8 characters or more."),
});
```

> You can migrate from Zod to Valibot using our [migration guide](/guides/migrate-from-zod/). It provides a codemod and a detailed overview of the differences between the two libraries.

#### Performance

With a schema library, a distinction must be made between startup performance and runtime performance. Startup performance describes the time required to load and initialize the library. This benchmark is mainly influenced by the bundle size and the amount of work required to create a schema. Runtime performance describes the time required to validate unknown data using a schema.

Since Valibot's implementation is optimized to minimize the bundle size and the effort of initialization, there is hardly any library that performs better in a [TTI](https://web.dev/articles/tti) benchmark. In terms of runtime performance, Valibot is in the midfield. Roughly speaking, the library is about twice as fast as [Zod](https://zod.dev/), but much slower than [Typia](https://typia.io/) and [TypeBox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox), because we don't yet use a compiler that can generate highly optimized runtime code, and our implementation doesn't allow the use of the [`Function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function) constructor.

> Further details on performance can be found in the [bachelor's thesis](/thesis.pdf) Valibot is based on.

### LLMs.txt

If you are using AI to generate Valibot schemas, you can use our LLMs.txt files to help the AI better understand the library.

#### What is LLMs.txt?

An [LLMs.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) file is a plain text file that provides instructions or metadata for large language models (LLMs). It often specifies how the LLMs should process or interact with content. It is similar to a robots.txt file, but is tailored for AI models.

#### Available routes

We provide several LLMs.txt routes. Use the route that works best with your AI tool.

- [`llms.txt`](/llms.txt) contains a table of contents with links to Markdown files
- [`llms-full.txt`](/llms-full.txt) contains the Markdown content of the entire docs
- [`llms-guides.txt`](/llms-guides.txt) contains the Markdown content of the guides
- [`llms-api.txt`](/llms-api.txt) contains the Markdown content of the API reference

#### How to use it

To help you get started, here are some examples of how the LLMs.txt files can be used with various AI tools.

> Please help us by adding more examples of other AI tools. If you use a tool that supports LLMs.txt files, please [open a pull request](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/pulls) to add it to this page.

##### Cursor

You can add a custom documentation as context in Cursor using the `@Docs` feature. Read more about it [here](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-docs).

## Main concepts (guides)

### Mental model

Valibot's mental model is mainly divided between **schemas**, **methods**, and **actions**. Since each functionality is imported as its own function, it is crucial to understand this concept as it makes working with the modular API design much easier.

<MentalModelDark
  alt="Code example with a schema, method and actions"
  class="hidden dark:block"
/>
<MentalModelLight
  alt="Code example with a schema, method and actions"
  class="dark:hidden"
/>

> The <Link href="/api/">API reference</Link> gives you a great overview of all schemas, methods, and actions. For each one, the corresponding reference page also lists down other related schemas, methods, and actions for better discoverability.

#### Schemas

Schemas are the starting point for using Valibot. They allow you to validate **a specific data type**, like a string, object, or date. Each schema is independent. They can be reused or even nested to reflect more complex data structures.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const BookSchema = v.object({
  title: v.string(),
  numberOfPages: v.number(),
  publication: v.date(),
  tags: v.array(v.string()),
});
```

Every schema function returns an accesible object that contains all its properties. However, in most cases you don't need to access them directly. Instead, you use methods that help you modify or use a schema.

#### Methods

Methods help you either **modify or use a schema**. For example, the <Link href="/api/parse/">`parse`</Link> method helps you parse unknown data based on a schema. When you use a method, you always pass the schema as the first argument.

```ts
import * as v from 'valibot';

const BookSchema = v.object({…});

function createBook(data: unknown) {
  return v.parse(BookSchema, data);
}
```

> Most methods are used with schemas. However, there are a few exceptions, such as <Link href="/api/forward/">`forward`</Link> and <Link href="/api/flatten/">`flatten`</Link>, which are used with actions or issues.

#### Actions

Actions help you to **further validate or transform** a specific data type. They are used exclusively in conjunction with the <Link href="/api/pipe/">`pipe`</Link> method, which extends the functionality of a schema by adding additional validation and transformation rules. For example, the following schema can be used to trim a string and check if it is a valid email address.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const EmailSchema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.trim(), v.email());
```

Actions are very powerful. There are basically no limits to what you can do with them. Besides basic validations and transformations as shown in the example above, they also allow you to modify the output type with actions like <Link href="/api/readonly/">`readonly`</Link> and <Link href="/api/brand/">`brand`</Link>.

### Schemas

Schemas allow you to validate a specific data type. They are similar to type definitions in TypeScript. Besides primitive values like strings and complex values like objects, Valibot also supports special cases like literals, unions and custom types.

#### Primitive values

Valibot supports the creation of schemas for any primitive data type. These are immutable values that are stored directly in the stack, unlike objects where only a reference to the heap is stored.

<ApiList
label="Primitive schemas"
items={[
'bigint',
'boolean',
'null',
'number',
'string',
'symbol',
'undefined',
]}
/>

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const BigintSchema = v.bigint(); // bigint
const BooleanSchema = v.boolean(); // boolean
const NullSchema = v.null(); // null
const NumberSchema = v.number(); // number
const StringSchema = v.string(); // string
const SymbolSchema = v.symbol(); // symbol
const UndefinedSchema = v.undefined(); // undefined
```

#### Complex values

Among complex values, Valibot supports objects, records, arrays, tuples, and several other classes.

> There are various methods for objects such as <Link href="/api/pick/">`pick`</Link>, <Link href="/api/omit/">`omit`</Link>, <Link href="/api/partial/">`partial`</Link> and <Link href="/api/required/">`required`</Link>. Learn more about them <Link href="/guides/methods/#object-methods">here</Link>.

<ApiList
label="Complex schemas"
items={[
'array',
'blob',
'date',
'file',
'function',
'looseObject',
'looseTuple',
'map',
'object',
'objectWithRest',
'promise',
'record',
'set',
'strictObject',
'strictTuple',
'tuple',
'tupleWithRest',
]}
/>

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const ArraySchema = v.array(v.string()); // string[]
const BlobSchema = v.blob(); // Blob
const DateSchema = v.date(); // Date
const FileSchema = v.file(); // File
const FunctionSchema = v.function(); // (...args: unknown[]) => unknown
const LooseObjectSchema = v.looseObject({ key: v.string() }); // { key: string }
const LooseTupleSchema = v.looseTuple([v.string(), v.number()]); // [string, number]
const MapSchema = v.map(v.string(), v.number()); // Map<string, number>
const ObjectSchema = v.object({ key: v.string() }); // { key: string }
const ObjectWithRestSchema = v.objectWithRest({ key: v.string() }, v.null()); // { key: string } & { [key: string]: null }
const PromiseSchema = v.promise(); // Promise<unknown>
const RecordSchema = v.record(v.string(), v.number()); // Record<string, number>
const SetSchema = v.set(v.number()); // Set<number>
const StrictObjectSchema = v.strictObject({ key: v.string() }); // { key: string }
const StrictTupleSchema = v.strictTuple([v.string(), v.number()]); // [string, number]
const TupleSchema = v.tuple([v.string(), v.number()]); // [string, number]
const TupleWithRestSchema = v.tupleWithRest([v.string(), v.number()], v.null()); // [string, number, ...null[]]
```

#### Special cases

Beyond primitive and complex values, there are also schema functions for more special cases.

const AnySchema = v.any(); // any
const CustomSchema = v.custom<`${number}px`>(isPixelString); // `${number}px`
const EnumSchema = v.enum(Direction); // Direction

const PicklistSchema = v.picklist(["a", "b"]); // 'a' | 'b'
const UndefinedableSchema = v.undefinedable(v.string()); // string | undefined
const UnionSchema = v.union([v.string(), v.number()]); // string | number
const UnknownSchema = v.unknown(); // unknown
const VariantSchema = v.variant("type", [
  v.object({ type: v.literal("a"), foo: v.string() }),
  v.object({ type: v.literal("b"), bar: v.number() }),
]); // { type: 'a'; foo: string } | { type: 'b'; bar: number }
const VoidSchema = v.void(); // void
```

### Pipelines

For detailed validations and transformations, a schema can be wrapped in a pipeline. Especially for schema functions like <Link href="/api/string/">`string`</Link>, <Link href="/api/number/">`number`</Link>, <Link href="/api/date/">`date`</Link>, <Link href="/api/object/">`object`</Link>, and <Link href="/api/array/">`array`</Link>, this feature is useful for validating properties beyond the raw data type.

#### How it works

In simple words, a pipeline is a list of schemas and actions that synchronously passes through the input data. It must always start with a schema, followed by up to 19 schemas or actions. Each schema and action can examine and modify the input. The pipeline is therefore perfect for detailed validations and transformations.

##### Example

For example, the pipeline feature can be used to trim a string and make sure that it is an email that ends with a specific domain.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const EmailSchema = v.pipe(
  v.string(),
  v.trim(),
  v.email(),
  v.endsWith("@example.com")
);
```

#### Validations

Pipeline validation actions examine the input and, if the input does not meet a certain condition, return an issue. If the input is valid, it is returned as the output and, if present, picked up by the next action in the pipeline.

> Whenever possible, pipelines are run completely, even if an issue has occurred, to collect all possible issues. If you want to abort the pipeline early after the first issue, you need to set the `abortPipeEarly` option to `true`. Learn more about this <Link href="/guides/parse-data/#configuration">here</Link>.

<ApiList

'url',
'uuid',
'value',
'values',
'words',
]}
/>

Some of these actions can be combined with different schemas. For example, <Link href="/api/minValue/">`minValue`</Link> can be used to validate the minimum value of <Link href="/api/string/">`string`</Link>, <Link href="/api/number/">`number`</Link>, <Link href="/api/bigint/">`bigint`</Link>, and <Link href="/api/date/">`date`</Link>.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const StringSchema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.minValue("foo"));
const NumberSchema = v.pipe(v.number(), v.minValue(1234));
const BigintSchema = v.pipe(v.bigint(), v.minValue(1234n));
const DateSchema = v.pipe(v.date(), v.minValue(new Date()));
```

##### Custom validation

For custom validations, <Link href="/api/check/">`check`</Link> can be used. If the function passed as the first argument returns `false`, an issue is returned. Otherwise, the input is considered valid.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";
import { isValidUsername } from "~/utils";

const UsernameSchema = v.pipe(
  v.string(),
  v.check(isValidUsername, "This username is invalid.")
);
```

> You can forward the issues of a pipeline validation to a child. See the <Link href="/guides/methods/#forward">methods</Link> guide for more information.

#### Transformations

Pipeline transformation actions allow to change the value and data type of the input data. This can be useful for example to remove spaces at the beginning or end of a string or to force a minimum or maximum value.

<ApiList
label="Transformation actions"
items={[
'brand',
'filterItems',
'findItem',
'flavor',
'mapItems',
'rawTransform',
'readonly',
'reduceItems',
'sortItems',
'toLowerCase',
'toMaxValue',
'toMinValue',
'toUpperCase',
'transform',
'trim',
'trimEnd',
'trimStart',
]}
/>

For example, the pipeline of the following schema enforces a minimum value of 10. If the input is less than 10, it is replaced with the specified minimum value.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const NumberSchema = v.pipe(v.number(), v.toMinValue(10));
```

##### Custom transformation

For custom transformations, <Link href="/api/transform/">`transform`</Link> can be used. The function passed as the first argument is called with the input data and the return value defines the output. The following transformation changes the output of the schema to `null` for any number less than 10.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const NumberSchema = v.pipe(
  v.number(),
  v.transform((input) => (input < 10 ? null : input))
);
```

#### Metadata

In addition to the validation and transformation actions, a pipeline can also be used to add metadata to a schema. This can be useful when working with AI tools or for documentation purposes.

<ApiList
label="Metadata actions"
items={['description', 'metadata', 'title']}
/>

```ts
const UsernameSchema = v.pipe(
  v.string(),
  v.regex(/^[a-z0-9_-]{4,16}$/iu),
  v.title("Username"),
  v.description(
    "A username must be between 4 and 16 characters long and can only contain letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens."
  )
);
```

### Parse data

Now that you've learned how to create a schema, let's look at how you can use it to validate unknown data and make it type-safe. There are three different ways to do this.

> Each schema has a `~run` method. However, this is an internal API and should only be used if you know what you are doing.

#### Parse and throw

The <Link href="/api/parse/">`parse`</Link> method will throw a <Link href="/api/ValiError/">`ValiError`</Link> if the input does not match the schema. Therefore, you should use a try/catch block to catch errors. If the input matches the schema, it is valid and the output of the schema will be returned with the correct TypeScript type.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

try {
  const EmailSchema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.email());
  const email = v.parse(EmailSchema, "jane@example.com");

  // Handle errors if one occurs
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

#### Parse and return

If you want issues to be returned instead of thrown, you can use <Link href="/api/safeParse/">`safeParse`</Link>. The returned value then contains the `.success` property, which is `true` if the input is valid or `false` otherwise.

If the input is valid, you can use `.output` to get the output of the schema validation. Otherwise, if the input was invalid, the issues found can be accessed via `.issues`.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const EmailSchema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.email());
const result = v.safeParse(EmailSchema, "jane@example.com");

if (result.success) {
  const email = result.output;
} else {
  console.log(result.issues);
}
```

#### Type guards

Another way to validate data that can be useful in individual cases is to use a type guard. You can use either a type predicate with the <Link href="/api/is/">`is`</Link> method or an assertion function with the <Link href="/api/assert/">`assert`</Link> method.

If a type guard is used, the issues of the validation cannot be accessed. Also, transformations have no effect and unknown keys of an object are not removed. Therefore, this approach is not as safe and powerful as the two previous ways. Also, due to a TypeScript limitation, it can currently only be used with synchronous schemas.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const EmailSchema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.email());
const data: unknown = "jane@example.com";

if (v.is(EmailSchema, data)) {
  const email = data; // string
}
```

#### Configuration

By default, Valibot exhaustively collects every issue during validation to give you detailed feedback on why the input does not match the schema. If this is not required for your use case, you can control this behavior with `abortEarly` and `abortPipeEarly` to improve the performance of validation.

##### Abort validation

If you set `abortEarly` to `true`, data validation immediately aborts upon finding the first issue. If you just want to know if some data matches a schema, but you don't care about the details, this can improve performance.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

try {
  const ProfileSchema = v.object({
    name: v.string(),
    bio: v.string(),
  });
  const profile = v.parse(
    ProfileSchema,
    { name: "Jane", bio: "" },
    { abortEarly: true }
  );

  // Handle errors if one occurs
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

##### Abort pipeline

If you only set `abortPipeEarly` to `true`, the validation within a pipeline will only abort after finding the first issue. For example, if you only want to show the first error of a field when validating a form, you can use this option to improve performance.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

try {
  const EmailSchema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.email(), v.endsWith("@example.com"));
  const email = v.parse(EmailSchema, "jane@example.com", {
    abortPipeEarly: true,
  });

  // Handle errors if one occurs
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

### Infer types

Another cool feature of schemas is the ability to infer input and output types. This makes your work even easier because you don't have to write the type definition yourself.

#### Infer input types

The input type of a schema corresponds to the TypeScript type that the incoming data of a schema must match to be valid. To extract this type you use the utility type <Link href="/api/InferInput/">`InferInput`</Link>.

> You are probably interested in the input type only in special cases. In most cases, the output type should be sufficient.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const LoginSchema = v.object({
  email: v.string(),
  password: v.string(),
});

type LoginInput = v.InferInput<typeof LoginSchema>; // { email: string; password: string }
```

#### Infer output types

The output type differs from the input type only if you use <Link href="/api/optional/">`optional`</Link>, <Link href="/api/nullable/">`nullable`</Link>, <Link href="/api/nullish/">`nullish`</Link> or <Link href="/api/undefinedable/">`undefinedable`</Link> with a default value or <Link href="/api/brand/">`brand`</Link>, <Link href="/api/readonly/">`readonly`</Link> or <Link href="/api/transform/">`transform`</Link> to transform the input or data type of a schema after validation. The output type corresponds to the output of <Link href="/api/parse/">`parse`</Link> and <Link href="/api/safeParse/">`safeParse`</Link>. To infer it, you use the utility type <Link href="/api/InferOutput/">`InferOutput`</Link>.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";
import { hashPassword } from "~/utils";

const LoginSchema = v.pipe(
  v.object({
    email: v.string(),
    password: v.pipe(v.string(), v.transform(hashPassword)),
  }),
  v.transform((input) => {
    return {
      ...input,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    };
  })
);

type LoginOutput = v.InferOutput<typeof LoginSchema>; // { email: string; password: string; timestamp: string }
```

#### Infer issue types

You can also infer the possible issues of a schema. This can be useful if you want to handle the issues in a particular way. To extract this information from a schema you use the utility type <Link href="/api/InferIssue/">`InferIssue`</Link>.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const LoginSchema = v.object({
  email: v.pipe(v.string(), v.email()),
  password: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(8)),
});

type Issue = v.InferIssue<typeof LoginSchema>; // v.ObjectIssue | v.StringIssue | v.EmailIssue<string> | v.MinLengthIssue<string, 8>
```

### Methods

Apart from <Link href="/api/parse/">`parse`</Link> and <Link href="/api/safeParse/">`safeParse`</Link>, Valibot offers some more methods to make working with your schemas easier. In the following we distinguish between schema, object and pipeline methods.

#### Schema methods

Schema methods add functionality, simplify ergonomics, and help you use schemas for validation and data extraction.

<ApiList
label="Schema methods"
items={[
'assert',
'config',
'fallback',
'flatten',
'getDefault',
'getDefaults',
'getDescription',
'getFallback',
'getFallbacks',
'getMetadata',
'getTitle',
'is',
'message',
'parse',
'safeParse',
'summarize',
'pipe',
'unwrap',
]}
/>

> For more information on <Link href="/api/pipe/">`pipe`</Link>, see the <Link href="/guides/pipelines/">pipelines</Link> guide. For more information on validation methods, see the <Link href="/guides/parse-data/">parse data</Link> guide. For more information on <Link href="/api/flatten/">`flatten`</Link>, see the <Link href="/guides/issues/#formatting">issues</Link> guide.

##### Fallback

If an issue occurs while validating your schema, you can catch it with <Link href="/api/fallback/">`fallback`</Link> to return a predefined value instead.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const StringSchema = v.fallback(v.string(), "hello");
const stringOutput = v.parse(StringSchema, 123); // 'hello'
```

#### Object methods

Object methods make it easier for you to work with object schemas. They are strongly oriented towards TypeScript's utility types.

<ApiList
label="Object methods"
items={['keyof', 'omit', 'partial', 'pick', 'required']}
/>

##### TypeScript similarities

Like in TypeScript, you can make the values of an object optional with <Link href="/api/partial/">`partial`</Link>, make them required with <Link href="/api/required/">`required`</Link>, and even include/exclude certain values from an existing schema with <Link href="/api/pick/">`pick`</Link> and <Link href="/api/omit/">`omit`</Link>.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

// TypeScript
type Object1 = Partial<{ key1: string; key2: number }>;

// Valibot
const object1 = v.partial(v.object({ key1: v.string(), key2: v.number() }));

// TypeScript
type Object2 = Pick<Object1, "key1">;

// Valibot
const object2 = v.pick(object1, ["key1"]);
```

#### Pipeline methods

Pipeline methods modify the results of validations and transformations within a pipeline.

<ApiList label="Pipeline methods" items={['forward']} />

> For more info about our pipeline feature, see the <Link href="/guides/pipelines/">pipelines</Link> guide.

##### Forward

‎<Link href="/api/forward/">`forward`</Link> allows you to associate an issue with a nested schema. For example, if you want to check that both password entries in a registration form match, you can use it to forward the issue to the second password field in case of an error. This allows you to display the error message in the correct place.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const RegisterSchema = v.pipe(
  v.object({
    email: v.pipe(
      v.string(),
      v.nonEmpty("Please enter your email."),
      v.email("The email address is badly formatted.")
    ),
    password1: v.pipe(
      v.string(),
      v.nonEmpty("Please enter your password."),
      v.minLength(8, "Your password must have 8 characters or more.")
    ),
    password2: v.string(),
  }),
  v.forward(
    v.partialCheck(
      [["password1"], ["password2"]],
      (input) => input.password1 === input.password2,
      "The two passwords do not match."
    ),
    ["password2"]
  )
);
```

### Issues

When validating unknown data against a schema, Valibot collects information about each issue. If there is at least one issue, these are returned in an array. Each issue provides detailed information for you or your users to fix the problem.

#### Issue info

A single issue conforms to the TypeScript type definition below.

```ts
type BaseIssue = {
  // Required info
  kind: "schema" | "validation" | "transformation";
  type: string;
  input: unknown;
  expected: string | null;
  received: string;
  message: string;

  // Optional info
  requirement?: unknown;
  path?: IssuePath;
  issues?: Issues;
  lang?: string;
  abortEarly?: boolean;
  abortPipeEarly?: boolean;
  skipPipe?: boolean;
};
```

##### Required info

Each issue contains the following required information.

###### Kind

`kind` describes the kind of the problem. If an input does not match the data type, for example a number was passed instead of a string, `kind` has the value `'schema'`. In all other cases, the reason is not the data type but the actual content of the data. For example, if a string is invalid because it does not match a regex, `kind` has the value `'validation'`.

###### Type

`type` describes which function did the validation. If the schema function <Link href="/api/array/">`array`</Link> detects that the input is not an array, `type` has the value `'array'`. If the <Link href="/api/minLength/">`minLength`</Link> validation function detects that an array is too short, `type` has the value `'min_length'`.

###### Input

`input` contains the input data where the issue was found. For complex data, for example objects, `input` contains the value of the respective key that does not match the schema.

###### Expected

`expected` is a language-neutral string that describes the data property that was expected. It can be used to create useful error messages. If your users aren't developers, you can replace the language-neutral symbols with language-specific words.

###### Received

`received` is a language-neutral string that describes the data property that was received. It can be used to create useful error messages. If your users aren't developers, you can replace the language-neutral symbols with language-specific words.

###### Message

`message` contains a human-understandable error message that can be fully customized as described in our <Link href="/guides/quick-start/#error-messages">quick start</Link> and <Link href="/guides/internationalization/">internationalization</Link> guide.

##### Optional info

Some issues contain further optional information.

###### Requirement

`requirement` can contain further validation information. For example, if the <Link href="/api/minLength/">`minLength`</Link> validation function detects that a string is too short, `requirement` contains the minimum length that the string should have.

###### Path

`path` is an array of objects that describes where an issue is located within complex data. Each path item contains the following information.

> The `input` of a path item may differ from the `input` of its issue. This is because path items are subsequently added by parent schemas and are related to their input. Transformations of child schemas are not taken into account.

```ts
type PathItem = {
  type: string;
  origin: "key" | "value";
  input: unknown;
  key?: unknown;
  value: unknown;
};
```

For example, you can use the following code to create a dot path.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const dotPath = v.getDotPath(issue);
```

###### Issues

`issues` currently only occur when using <Link href="/api/union/">`union`</Link> and contains all issues of the schemas of an union type.

###### Config

`lang` can be used as part of our <Link href="/guides/internationalization/">i18n feature</Link> to define the required language. `abortEarly` and `abortPipeEarly` gives you an info that the validation was aborted prematurely. You can find more info about this in the <Link href="/guides/parse-data/#configuration">parse data</Link> guide. These are all configurations that you can control yourself.

#### Formatting

For common use cases such as form validation, Valibot includes small built-in functions for formatting issues. However, once you understand how they work, you can easily format them yourself and put them in the right form for your use case.

##### Flatten errors

If you are only interested in the error messages of each issue to show them to your users, you can convert an array of issues to a flat object with <Link href="/api/flatten/">`flatten`</Link>. Below is an example.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const ObjectSchema = v.object({
  foo: v.string('Value of "foo" is missing.'),
  bar: v.object({
    baz: v.string('Value of "bar.baz" is missing.'),
  }),
});

const result = v.safeParse(ObjectSchema, { bar: {} });

if (result.issues) {
  console.log(v.flatten<typeof ObjectSchema>(result.issues));
}
```

The `result` returned in the code sample above this text contains the following issues.

```ts
[
  {
    kind: "schema",
    type: "string",
    input: undefined,
    expected: "string",
    received: "undefined",
    message: 'Value of "foo" is missing.',
    path: [
      {
        type: "object",
        origin: "value",
        input: {
          bar: {},
        },
        key: "foo",
        value: undefined,
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    kind: "schema",
    type: "string",
    input: undefined,
    expected: "string",
    received: "undefined",
    message: 'Value of "bar.baz" is missing.',
    path: [
      {
        type: "object",
        origin: "value",
        input: {
          bar: {},
        },
        key: "bar",
        value: {},
      },
      {
        type: "object",
        origin: "value",
        input: {},
        key: "baz",
        value: undefined,
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

However, with the help of <Link href="/api/flatten/">`flatten`</Link> the issues were converted to the following object.

```ts
{
  nested: {
    foo: ['Value of "foo" is missing.'],
    'bar.baz': ['Value of "bar.baz" is missing.'],
  },
};
```

## Schemas (guides)

### Objects

To validate objects with a schema, you can use <Link href="/api/object/">`object`</Link> or <Link href="/api/record/">`record`</Link>. You use <Link href="/api/object/">`object`</Link> for an object with a specific shape and <Link href="/api/record/">`record`</Link> for objects with any number of uniform entries.

#### Object schema

The first argument is used to define the specific structure of the object. Each entry consists of a key and a schema as the value. The entries of the input are then validated against these schemas.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const ObjectSchema = v.object({
  key1: v.string(),
  key2: v.number(),
});
```

##### Loose and strict objects

The <Link href="/api/object/">`object`</Link> schema removes unknown entries. This means that entries that you have not defined in the first argument are not validated and added to the output. You can change this behavior by using the <Link href="/api/looseObject/">`looseObject`</Link> or <Link href="/api/strictObject/">`strictObject`</Link> schema instead.

The <Link href="/api/looseObject/">`looseObject`</Link> schema allows unknown entries and adds them to the output. The <Link href="/api/strictObject/">`strictObject`</Link> schema forbids unknown entries and returns an issue for the first unknown entry found.

##### Object with specific rest

Alternatively, you can also use the <Link href="/api/objectWithRest/">`objectWithRest`</Link> schema to define a specific schema for unknown entries. Any entries not defined in the first argument are then validated against the schema of the second argument.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const ObjectSchema = v.objectWithRest(
  {
    key1: v.string(),
    key2: v.number(),
  },
  v.null()
);
```

##### Pipeline validation

To validate the value of an entry based on another entry, you can wrap you schema with the <Link href="/api/check/">`check`</Link> validation action in a pipeline. You can also use <Link href="/api/forward/">`forward`</Link> to assign the issue to a specific object key in the event of an error.

> If you only want to validate specific entries, we recommend using <Link href="/api/partialCheck/">`partialCheck`</Link> instead as <Link href="/api/check/">`check`</Link> can only be executed if the input is fully typed.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const CalculationSchema = v.pipe(
  v.object({
    a: v.number(),
    b: v.number(),
    sum: v.number(),
  }),
  v.forward(
    v.check(({ a, b, sum }) => a + b === sum, "The calculation is incorrect."),
    ["sum"]
  )
);
```

#### Record schema

For an object with any number of uniform entries, <Link href="/api/record/">`record`</Link> is the right choice. The schema passed as the first argument validates the keys of your record, and the schema passed as the second argument validates the values.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const RecordSchema = v.record(v.string(), v.number()); // Record<string, number>
```

##### Specific record keys

Instead of <Link href="/api/string/">`string`</Link>, you can also use <Link href="/api/custom/">`custom`</Link>, <Link href="/api/enum/">`enum`</Link>, <Link href="/api/literal/">`literal`</Link>, <Link href="/api/picklist/">`picklist`</Link> or <Link href="/api/union/">`union`</Link> to validate the keys.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const RecordSchema = v.record(v.picklist(["key1", "key2"]), v.number()); // { key1?: number; key2?: number }
```

Note that <Link href="/api/record/">`record`</Link> marks all literal keys as optional in this case. If you want to make them required, you can use the <Link href="/api/object/">`object`</Link> schema with the <Link href="/api/entriesFromList/">`entriesFromList`</Link> util instead.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const RecordSchema = v.object(v.entriesFromList(["key1", "key2"], v.number())); // { key1: number; key2: number }
```

##### Pipeline validation

To validate the value of an entry based on another entry, you can wrap you schema with the <Link href="/api/check/">`check`</Link> validation action in a pipeline. You can also use <Link href="/api/forward/">`forward`</Link> to assign the issue to a specific record key in the event of an error.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const CalculationSchema = v.pipe(
  v.record(v.picklist(["a", "b", "sum"]), v.number()),
  v.forward(
    v.check(
      ({ a, b, sum }) => (a || 0) + (b || 0) === (sum || 0),
      "The calculation is incorrect."
    ),
    ["sum"]
  )
);
```

### Arrays

To validate arrays with a schema you can use <Link href="/api/array/">`array`</Link> or <Link href="/api/tuple/">`tuple`</Link>. You use <Link href="/api/tuple/">`tuple`</Link> if your array has a specific shape and <Link href="/api/array/">`array`</Link> if it has any number of uniform items.

#### Array schema

The first argument you pass to <Link href="/api/array/">`array`</Link> is a schema, which is used to validate the items of the array.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const ArraySchema = v.array(v.number()); // number[]
```

##### Pipeline validation

To validate the length or contents of the array, you can use a pipeline.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const ArraySchema = v.pipe(
  v.array(v.string()),
  v.minLength(1),
  v.maxLength(5),
  v.includes("foo"),
  v.excludes("bar")
);
```

#### Tuple schema

A <Link href="/api/tuple/">`tuple`</Link> is an array with a specific shape. The first argument that you pass to the function is a tuple of schemas that defines its shape.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const TupleSchema = v.tuple([v.string(), v.number()]); // [string, number]
```

##### Loose and strict tuples

The <Link href="/api/tuple/">`tuple`</Link> schema removes unknown items. This means that items that you have not defined in the first argument are not validated and added to the output. You can change this behavior by using the <Link href="/api/looseTuple/">`looseTuple`</Link> or <Link href="/api/strictTuple/">`strictTuple`</Link> schema instead.

The <Link href="/api/looseTuple/">`looseTuple`</Link> schema allows unknown items and adds them to the output. The <Link href="/api/strictTuple/">`strictTuple`</Link> schema forbids unknown items and returns an issue for the first unknown item found.

##### Tuple with specific rest

Alternatively, you can also use the <Link href="/api/tupleWithRest/">`tupleWithRest`</Link> schema to define a specific schema for unknown items. Any items not defined in the first argument are then validated against the schema of the second argument.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const TupleSchema = v.tupleWithRest([v.string(), v.number()], v.null());
```

##### Pipeline validation

Similar to arrays, you can use a pipeline to validate the length and contents of a tuple.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const TupleSchema = v.pipe(
  v.tupleWithRest([v.string()], v.string()),
  v.maxLength(5),
  v.includes("foo"),
  v.excludes("bar")
);
```

### Optionals

It often happens that `undefined` or `null` should also be accepted instead of the value. To make the API more readable for this and to reduce boilerplate, Valibot offers a shortcut for this functionality with <Link href="/api/optional/">`optional`</Link>, <Link href="/api/exactOptional/">`exactOptional`</Link>, <Link href="/api/undefinedable/">`undefinedable`</Link>, <Link href="/api/nullable/">`nullable`</Link> and <Link href="/api/nullish/">`nullish`</Link>.

#### How it works

To accept `undefined` and/or `null` besides your actual value, you just have to wrap the schema in <Link href="/api/optional/">`optional`</Link>, <Link href="/api/exactOptional/">`exactOptional`</Link>, <Link href="/api/undefinedable/">`undefinedable`</Link>, <Link href="/api/nullable/">`nullable`</Link> or <Link href="/api/nullish/">`nullish`</Link>.

> Note: <Link href="/api/exactOptional/">`exactOptional`</Link> allows missing entries in objects, but does not allow `undefined` as a specified value.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const OptionalStringSchema = v.optional(v.string()); // string | undefined
const ExactOptionalStringSchema = v.exactOptional(v.string()); // string
const UndefinedableStringSchema = v.undefinedable(v.string()); // string | undefined
const NullableStringSchema = v.nullable(v.string()); // string | null
const NullishStringSchema = v.nullish(v.string()); // string | null | undefined
```

##### Use in objects

When used inside of objects, <Link href="/api/optional/">`optional`</Link>, <Link href="/api/exactOptional/">`exactOptional`</Link> and <Link href="/api/nullish/">`nullish`</Link> is a special case, as it also marks the value as optional in TypeScript with a question mark.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const OptionalKeySchema = v.object({ key: v.optional(v.string()) }); // { key?: string | undefined }
```

#### Default values

What makes <Link href="/api/optional/">`optional`</Link>, <Link href="/api/exactOptional/">`exactOptional`</Link>, <Link href="/api/undefinedable/">`undefinedable`</Link>, <Link href="/api/nullable/">`nullable`</Link> and <Link href="/api/nullish/">`nullish`</Link> unique is that the schema functions accept a default value as the second argument. Depending on the schema function, this default value is always used if the input is missing, `undefined` or `null`.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const OptionalStringSchema = v.optional(v.string(), "I'm the default!");

type OptionalStringInput = v.InferInput<typeof OptionalStringSchema>; // string | undefined
type OptionalStringOutput = v.InferOutput<typeof OptionalStringSchema>; // string
```

By providing a default value, the input type of the schema now differs from the output type. The schema in the example now accepts `string` and `undefined` as input, but returns a string as output in both cases.

##### Dynamic default values

In some cases it is necessary to generate the default value dynamically. For this purpose, a function that generates and returns the default value can also be passed as the second argument.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const NullableDateSchema = v.nullable(v.date(), () => new Date());
```

The previous example thus creates a new instance of the [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) class for each validation with `null` as input, which is then used as the default value.

##### Dependent default values

In rare cases, a default value for an optional entry may depend on the values of another entries in the same object. This can be achieved by using <Link href="/api/transform/">`transform`</Link> in the <Link href="/api/pipe/">`pipe`</Link> of the object.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const CalculationSchema = v.pipe(
  v.object({
    a: v.number(),
    b: v.number(),
    sum: v.optional(v.number()),
  }),
  v.transform((input) => ({
    ...input,
    sum: input.sum === undefined ? input.a + input.b : input.sum,
  }))
);
```

### Enums

An enumerated type is a data type that consists of a set of values. They can be represented by either an object, a TypeScript enum or, to keep things simple, an array. You use <Link href="/api/enum/">`enum`</Link> for objects and TypeScript enums and <Link href="/api/picklist/">`picklist`</Link> for arrays.

#### Enum schema

Since TypeScript enums are transpiled to JavaScript objects by the TypeScript compiler, you can use the <Link href="/api/enum/">`enum`</Link> schema function for both. Just pass your enumerated data type as the first argument to the schema function. On validation, the schema checks whether the input matches one of the values in the enum.

```ts
import * as v from 'valibot';

// As JavaScript object
const Direction = {
  Left: 'LEFT',
  Right: 'RIGHT',
} as const;

// As TypeScript enum
enum Direction {
  Left = 'LEFT',
  Right = 'RIGHT',
}

const DirectionSchema = v.enum(Direction);
```

#### Picklist schema

For a set of values represented by an array, you can use the <Link href="/api/picklist/">`picklist`</Link> schema function. Just pass your array as the first argument to the schema function. On validation, the schema checks whether the input matches one of the items in the array.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const Direction = ["LEFT", "RIGHT"] as const;

const DirectionSchema = v.picklist(Direction);
```

##### Format array

In some cases, the array may not be in the correct format. In this case, simply use the [`.map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) method to bring it into the required format.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const countries = [
  { name: "Germany", code: "DE" },
  { name: "France", code: "FR" },
  { name: "United States", code: "US" },
] as const;

const CountrySchema = v.picklist(countries.map((country) => country.code));
```

### Unions

An union represents a logical OR relationship. You can apply this concept to your schemas with <Link href="/api/union/">`union`</Link> and <Link href="/api/variant/">`variant`</Link>. For [discriminated unions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes-func.html#discriminated-unions) you use <Link href="/api/variant/">`variant`</Link> and in all other cases you use <Link href="/api/union/">`union`</Link>.

#### Union schema

The schema function <Link href="/api/union/">`union`</Link> creates an OR relationship between any number of schemas that you pass as the first argument in the form of an array. On validation, the schema returns the result of the first schema that was successfully validated.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

// TypeScript
type Union = string | number;

// Valibot
const UnionSchema = v.union([v.string(), v.number()]);
```

If a bad input can be uniquely assigned to one of the schemas based on the data type, the result of that schema is returned. Otherwise, a general issue is returned that contains the issues of each schema as subissues. This is a special case within the library, as the issues of <Link href="/api/union/">`union`</Link> can contradict each other.

The following issues are returned if the input is `null` instead of a string or number. Since the input cannot be associated with a schema in this case, the issues of both schemas are returned as subissues.

```ts
[
  {
    kind: "schema",
    type: "union",
    input: null,
    expected: "string | number",
    received: "null",
    message: "Invalid type: Expected string | number but received null",
    issues: [
      {
        kind: "schema",
        type: "string",
        input: null,
        expected: "string",
        received: "null",
        message: "Invalid type: Expected string but received null",
      },
      {
        kind: "schema",
        type: "number",
        input: null,
        expected: "number",
        received: "null",
        message: "Invalid type: Expected number but received null",
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

#### Variant schema

For better performance, more type safety, and a more targeted output of issues, you can use <Link href="/api/variant/">`variant`</Link> for discriminated unions. Therefore, we recommend using <Link href="/api/variant/">`variant`</Link> over <Link href="/api/union/">`union`</Link> whenever possible. A discriminated union is an OR relationship between objects that can be distinguished by a specific key.

When you call the schema function, you first specify the discriminator key. This is used to determine the schema to use for validation based on the input. The object schemas, in the form of an array, follow as the second argument.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const VariantScheme = v.variant("type", [
  v.object({
    type: v.literal("foo"),
    foo: v.string(),
  }),
  v.object({
    type: v.literal("bar"),
    bar: v.number(),
  }),
]);
```

For very complex datasets, multiple <Link href="/api/variant/">`variant`</Link> schemas can also be deeply nested within one another.

### Intersections

An intersection represents a logical AND relationship. You can apply this concept to your schemas with <Link href="/api/intersect/">`intersect`</Link> and partially by merging multiple object schemas into a new one. We recommend this approach for simple object schemas, and <Link href="/api/intersect/">`intersect`</Link> for all other cases.

#### Intersect schema

The schema function <Link href="/api/intersect/">`intersect`</Link> creates an AND relationship between any number of schemas that you pass as the first argument in the form of an array. To pass the validation, the validation of each schema passed must be successful. If this is the case, the schema merges the output of the individual schemas and returns the result. If the validation fails, the schema returns any issues that occurred.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

// TypeScript
type Intersect = { foo: string } & { bar: number };

// Valibot
const IntersectSchema = v.intersect([
  v.object({ foo: v.string() }),
  v.object({ bar: v.number() }),
]);
```

#### Merge objects

Technically, there is a big difference between <Link href="/api/intersect/">`intersect`</Link> and object merging. <Link href="/api/intersect/">`intersect`</Link> is a schema function that executes the passed schemas during validation. In contrast, object merging is done during initialization to create a new object schema.

As a result, object merging usually has much better performance than <Link href="/api/intersect/">`intersect`</Link> when validating unknown data. Also, subsequent object properties overwrite the previous ones. This is not the case with <Link href="/api/intersect/">`intersect`</Link>, since the validation would fail if two properties with the same name are fundamentally different.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const ObjectSchema1 = v.object({ foo: v.string(), baz: v.number() });
const ObjectSchema2 = v.object({ bar: v.string(), baz: v.boolean() });

const MergedSchema = v.object({
  ...ObjectSchema1.entries,
  ...ObjectSchema2.entries,
}); // { foo: string; bar: string; baz: boolean }
```

In the previous code example, the `baz` property of the first object schema is overwritten by the `baz` property of the second object schema.

### Other

This guide explains other special schema functions such as <Link href="/api/literal/">`literal`</Link>, <Link href="/api/instance/">`instance`</Link>, <Link href="/api/custom/">`custom`</Link> and <Link href="/api/lazy/">`lazy`</Link> that are not covered in the other guides.

#### Literal schema

You can use <Link href="/api/literal/">`literal`</Link> to define a schema that matches a specific string, number or boolean value. Therefore, this schema is perfect for representing [literal types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#literal-types). Usage is simple, just pass the value you want to match as the first argument.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const StringLiteralSchema = v.literal("foo"); // 'foo'
const NumberLiteralSchema = v.literal(12345); // 12345
const BooleanLiteralSchema = v.literal(true); // true
```

#### Instance schema

With schema functions like <Link href="/api/blob/">`blob`</Link>, <Link href="/api/date/">`date`</Link>, <Link href="/api/map/">`map`</Link> and <Link href="/api/set/">`set`</Link> Valibot already covers the most common JavaScript classes. However, there are many more classes that you may want to validate. For this purpose, you can use the <Link href="/api/instance/">`instance`</Link> schema function. It takes a class as its first argument and returns a schema that matches only instances of that class.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const ErrorSchema = v.instance(Error); // Error
const UrlSchema = v.instance(URL); // URL
```

#### Custom schema

The <Link href="/api/custom/">`custom`</Link> schema function is a bit more advanced. It allows you to define a schema that matches a value based on a custom function. Use it whenever you need to define a schema that cannot be expressed using any of the other schema functions.

The function receives the value to validate as its first argument and must return a boolean value. If the function returns `true`, the value is considered valid. Otherwise, it is considered invalid.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const PixelStringSchema = v.custom<`${number}px`>((input) =>
  typeof input === "string" ? /^\d+px$/.test(input) : false
);
```

#### Lazy schema

The <Link href="/api/lazy/">`lazy`</Link> schema function allows you to define recursive schemas. A recursive schema is a schema that references itself. For example, you can use it to define a schema for a tree-like data structure.

> Due to a TypeScript limitation, the input and output types cannot be inferred automatically in this case. Therefore, you must explicitly specify these types using the <Link href="/api/GenericSchema/">`GenericSchema`</Link> type.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

type BinaryTree = {
  element: string;
  left: BinaryTree | null;
  right: BinaryTree | null;
};

const BinaryTreeSchema: v.GenericSchema<BinaryTree> = v.object({
  element: v.string(),
  left: v.nullable(v.lazy(() => BinaryTreeSchema)),
  right: v.nullable(v.lazy(() => BinaryTreeSchema)),
});
```

##### JSON schema

Another practical use case for `lazy` is a schema for all possible `JSON` values. These are all values that can be serialized and deserialized using `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

type JsonData =
  | string
  | number
  | boolean
  | null
  | { [key: string]: JsonData }
  | JsonData[];

const JsonSchema: v.GenericSchema<JsonData> = v.lazy(() =>
  v.union([
    v.string(),
    v.number(),
    v.boolean(),
    v.null(),
    v.record(v.string(), JsonSchema),
    v.array(JsonSchema),
  ])
);
```

## Advanced (guides)

### Naming convention

In many cases a schema is created and exported together with the inferred type. There are two naming conventions for this procedure that we recommend you to use when working with Valibot. In this guide we will explain both of them and share why we think they might make sense.

> You don't have to follow any of these conventions. They are only recommendations.

#### Convention 1

The first naming convention exports the schema and type with the same name. The advantage of this is that the names are short and the boilerplate is low, since the schema and type can be imported together.

We also recommend to follow the [PascalCase](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)>) naming convention. This means that each word starts with an uppercase letter. This is a common convention for TypeScript types, and since schemas basically provide runtime validation of types, it makes sense to use this convention for schemas as well.

##### Example

In the following example, a schema is created for a user object. In order to follow the naming convention, the schema and the type are exported with the same name.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

export const PublicUser = v.object({
  name: v.pipe(v.string(), v.maxLength(30)),
  email: v.pipe(v.string(), v.email()),
  avatar: v.nullable(v.file()),
  bio: v.pipe(v.string(), v.maxLength(1000)),
});

export type PublicUser = v.InferOutput<typeof PublicUser>;
```

The schema and type can then be imported and used together.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

import { PublicUser } from "./types";

// Use `PublicUser` as a type
const publicUsers: PublicUser[] = [];

publicUsers.push(
  // Use `PublicUser` as a schema
  v.parse(PublicUser, {
    name: "Jane Doe",
    email: "jane@example.com",
    avatar: null,
    bio: "Lorem ipsum ...",
  })
);
```

#### Convention 2

The first naming convention can cause naming conflicts with other classes and types. It also causes a problem when you need to export both the input and output types of a schema.

The second naming convention provides a solution. It also follows the [PascalCase](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)>) naming convention, but adds an appropriate suffix to each export. Schemas get the suffix `Schema`, input types get the suffix `Input` and output types get the suffix `Output`.

> If there is no difference between the input and output type, the suffix `Data` can optionally be used to indicate this.

This requires the schema and types to be imported separately, which increases the overhead. However, the naming convention is more precise, flexible, and works in any use case.

##### Example

In the following example, a schema is created for an image object. In order to follow the naming convention, the schema and the types are exported with different names.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

export const ImageSchema = v.object({
  status: v.optional(v.picklist(["public", "private"]), "private"),
  created: v.optional(v.date(), () => new Date()),
  title: v.pipe(v.string(), v.maxLength(100)),
  source: v.pipe(v.string(), v.url()),
  size: v.pipe(v.number(), v.minValue(0)),
});

export type ImageInput = v.InferInput<typeof ImageSchema>;
export type ImageOutput = v.InferOutput<typeof ImageSchema>;
```

The schema and the input and output types can then be imported and used separately.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

import { ImageInput, ImageOutput, ImageSchema } from "./types";

export function createImage(input: ImageInput): ImageOutput {
  return v.parse(ImageSchema, input);
}
```

> Do you have ideas for improving these conventions? We welcome your feedback and suggestions. Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/issues/new) on GitHub.

### Async validation

By default, Valibot validates each schema synchronously. This is usually the fastest way to validate unknown data, but sometimes you need to validate something asynchronously. For example, you might want to check if a username already exists in your database.

#### How it works

To be able to do this, Valibot provides an asynchronous implementation when necessary. The only difference is that the asynchronous implementation is promise-based. Otherwise, the API and functionality is exactly the same.

##### Naming

The asynchronous implementation starts with the same name as the synchronous one, but adds the suffix `Async` to the end. For example, the asynchronous implementation of <Link href="/api/pipe/">`pipe`</Link> is called <Link href="/api/pipeAsync/">`pipeAsync`</Link> and the asynchronous implementation of <Link href="/api/object/">`object`</Link> is called <Link href="/api/objectAsync/">`objectAsync`</Link>.

##### Nesting

Asynchronous functions can only be nested inside other asynchronous functions. This means that if you need to validate a string within an object asynchronously, you must also switch the object validation to the asynchronous implementation.

This is not necessary in the other direction. You can nest synchronous functions within asynchronous functions, and we recommend that you do so in most cases to keep complexity and bundle size to a minimum.

###### Rule of thumb

We recommend that you always start with the synchronous implementation, and only move the necessary parts to the asynchronous implementation as needed. If you are using TypeScript, it is not possible to make a mistake here, as our API is completely type-safe and will notify you when you embed an asynchronous function into a synchronous function.

##### Example

Let's say you want to validate a profile object and the username should be checked asynchronously against your database. Only the object and username validation needs to be asynchronous, the rest can stay synchronous.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";
import { isUsernameAvailable } from "~/api";

const ProfileSchema = v.objectAsync({
  username: v.pipeAsync(v.string(), v.checkAsync(isUsernameAvailable)),
  avatar: v.pipe(v.string(), v.url()),
  description: v.pipe(v.string(), v.maxLength(1000)),
});
```

### JSON Schema

In favor of a larger feature set and smaller bundle size, Valibot is not implemented with JSON Schema in mind. However, in some use cases, you may still need a JSON Schema. This guide will show you how to convert Valibot schemas to JSON Schema format.

#### Valibot to JSON Schema

A large part of Valibot's schemas are JSON Schema compatible and can be easily converted to the JSON Schema format using the official `toJsonSchema` function. This function is provided via a separate package called [`@valibot/to-json-schema`](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/tree/main/packages/to-json-schema).

> See the [README](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/blob/main/packages/to-json-schema/README.md) of the `@valibot/to-json-schema` package for more details. It is also recommended that you take a look at <Link href="/blog/json-schema-package-upgrade/">this blog post</Link>, which highlights recent improvements.

```ts
import { toJsonSchema } from "@valibot/to-json-schema";
import * as v from "valibot";

const ValibotEmailSchema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.email());
const JsonEmailSchema = toJsonSchema(ValibotEmailSchema);
// -> { type: 'string', format: 'email' }
```

#### Cons of JSON Schema

Valibot schemas intentionally do not output JSON Schema natively. This is because JSON Schema is limited to JSON-compliant data structures. In addition, more advanced features like transformations are not supported. Since we want to leverage the full power of TypeScript, we output a custom format instead.

Another drawback of JSON Schema is that JSON Schema itself does not contain any validation logic. Therefore, an additional function is required that can validate the entire JSON Schema specification. This approach is usually not tree-shakable and results in a large bundle size.

In contrast, Valibot's API design and implementation is completely modular. Every schema is independent and contains its own validation logic. This allows the schemas to be plugged together like LEGO bricks, resulting in a much smaller bundle size due to tree shaking.

#### Pros of JSON Schema

Despite these drawbacks, JSON Schema is still widely used in the industry because it also has many advantages. For example, JSON Schemas can be used across programming languages and tools. In addition, JSON Schemas are serializable and can be easily stored in a database or transmitted over a network.

### Internationalization

Providing error messages in the native language of your users can improve the user experience and adoption rate of your software. That is why we offer several flexible ways to easily implement i18n.

#### Official translations

The fastest way to get started with i18n is to use Valibot's official translations. They are provided in a separate package called [`@valibot/i18n`](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/tree/main/packages/i18n).

> If you are missing a translation, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/issues/new) or pull request on GitHub.

##### Import translations

Each translation in this package is implemented modularly and exported as a submodule. This allows you to import only the translations you actually need to keep your bundle size small.

{/_ prettier-ignore _/}

```ts
// Import every translation (not recommended)
import "@valibot/i18n";
// Import every translation for a specific language
import "@valibot/i18n/de";
// Import only the translation for a specific pipeline function
import "@valibot/i18n/de/minLength";
// Import only the translation for schema functions
import "@valibot/i18n/de/schema";
```

The submodules use sideeffects to load the translations into a global storage that the schema and validation functions access when adding the error message to an issue.

##### Select language

The language used is then selected by the `lang` configuration. You can set it globally with <Link href="/api/setGlobalConfig/">`setGlobalConfig`</Link> or locally when parsing unknown data via <Link href="/api/parse/">`parse`</Link> or <Link href="/api/safeParse/">`safeParse`</Link>.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

// Set the language configuration globally
v.setGlobalConfig({ lang: "de" });

// Set the language configuration locally
v.parse(Schema, input, { lang: "de" });
```

#### Custom translations

You can use the same APIs as [`@valibot/i18n`](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/tree/main/packages/i18n) to add your own translations to the global storage. Alternatively, you can also pass them directly to a specific schema or validation function as the first optional argument.

> You can either enter the translations manually or use an i18n library like [Paraglide JS](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs).

##### Set translations globally

You can add translations with <Link href="/api/setGlobalMessage/">`setGlobalMessage`</Link>, <Link href="/api/setSchemaMessage/">`setSchemaMessage`</Link> and <Link href="/api/setSpecificMessage/">`setSpecificMessage`</Link> in three different hierarchy levels. When creating an issue, I first check if a specific translation is available, then the translation for schema functions, and finally the global translation.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

// Set the translation globally (can be used as a fallback)
v.setGlobalMessage((issue) => `Invalid input: ...`, "en");

// Set the translation globally for every schema functions
v.setSchemaMessage((issue) => `Invalid type: ...`, "en");

// Set the translation globally for a specific function
v.setSpecificMessage(v.minLength, (issue) => `Invalid length: ...`, "en");
```

##### Set translations locally

If you prefer to define the translations individually, you can pass them as the first optional argument to schema and validation functions. We recommend using an i18n library like [Paraglide JS](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs) in this case.

{/_ prettier-ignore _/}

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

import * as m from "./paraglide/messages.js";

const LoginSchema = v.object({
  email: v.pipe(
    v.string(),
    v.nonEmpty(m.emailRequired),
    v.email(m.emailInvalid)
  ),
  password: v.pipe(
    v.string(),
    v.nonEmpty(m.passwordRequired),
    v.minLength(8, m.passwordInvalid)
  ),
});
```

## Migration (guides)

### Migrate to v0.31.0

Migrating Valibot from an older version to v0.31.0 isn't complicated. Except for the new <Link href="/api/pipe/">`pipe`</Link> method, most things remain the same. The following guide will help you to migrate automatically or manually step by step and also point out important differences.

#### Automatic upgrade

We worked together with [Codemod](https://codemod.com/registry/valibot-migrate-to-v0-31-0) and [Grit](https://docs.grit.io/registry/github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/migrate_to_v0_31_0) to automatically upgrade your schemas to the new version with a single CLI command. Both codemods are similar. You can use one or the other. Simply run the command in the directory of your project.

> We recommend using a version control system like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) so that you can revert changes if the codemod screws something up.

```bash
### Codemod
npx codemod valibot/migrate-to-v0.31.0

### Grit
npx @getgrit/cli apply github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot#migrate_to_v0_31_0
```

Please create an [issue](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/issues/new) if you encounter any problems or unexpected behavior with the provided codemods.

#### Restructure code

As mentioned above, one of the biggest differences is the new <Link href="/api/pipe/">`pipe`</Link> method. Previously, you passed the pipeline as an array to a schema function. Now you pass the schema with various actions to the new <Link href="/api/pipe/">`pipe`</Link> method to extend a schema.

```ts
// Change this
const Schema = v.string([v.email()]);

// To this
const Schema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.email());
```

We will be publishing a [blog post](/blog/valibot-v0.31.0-is-finally-available/) soon explaining all the benefits of this change. In the meantime, you can read the description of discussion [#463](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/discussions/463) and PR [#502](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/pull/502), which introduced this change.

#### Change names

#### Special cases

More complex schemas may require a bit more restructuring. This section provides more details on how to migrate specific functions.

##### Objects and tuples

Previously, you could pass a `rest` argument to the <Link href="/api/object/">`object`</Link> and <Link href="/api/tuple/">`tuple`</Link> schemas to define the behavior for unknown entries and items. We have removed the `rest` argument to simplify the implementation and reduce the bundle size if this functionality is not needed. If you do need this functionality, there is now a new <Link href="/api/objectWithRest/">`objectWithRest`</Link> and <Link href="/api/tupleWithRest/">`tupleWithRest`</Link> schema.

```ts
// Change this
const ObjectSchema = v.object({ key: v.string() }, v.null_());
const TupleSchema = v.tuple([v.string()], v.null_());

// To this
const ObjectSchema = v.objectWithRest({ key: v.string() }, v.null_());
const TupleSchema = v.tupleWithRest([v.string()], v.null_());
```

To further improve the developer experience, we have also added a <Link href="/api/looseObject/">`looseObject`</Link>, <Link href="/api/looseTuple/">`looseTuple`</Link>, <Link href="/api/strictObject/">`strictObject`</Link> and <Link href="/api/strictTuple/">`strictTuple`</Link> schema. These schemas allow or disallow unknown entries or items.

```ts
// Change this
const LooseObjectSchema = v.object({ key: v.string() }, v.unknown());
const LooseTupleSchema = v.tuple([v.string()], v.unknown());
const StrictObjectSchema = v.object({ key: v.string() }, v.never());
const StrictTupleSchema = v.tuple([v.string()], v.never());

// To this
const LooseObjectSchema = v.looseObject({ key: v.string() });
const LooseTupleSchema = v.looseTuple([v.string()]);
const StrictObjectSchema = v.strictObject({ key: v.string() });
const StrictTupleSchema = v.strictTuple([v.string()]);
```

##### Object merging

Since there are now 4 different object schemas, we could no longer provide a simple `merge` function that works in all cases, as we never know which schema you want to merge the other objects into. But there is a simple workaround with a similar developer experience.

```ts
const ObjectSchema1 = v.object({ foo: v.string() });
const ObjectSchema2 = v.object({ bar: v.number() });

// Change this
const MergedObject = v.merge([ObjectSchema1, ObjectSchema2]);

// To this
const MergedObject = v.object({
  ...ObjectSchema1.entries,
  ...ObjectSchema2.entries,
});
```

##### Brand and transform

Previously, <Link href="/api/brand/">`brand`</Link> and <Link href="/api/transform/">`transform`</Link> were methods that could be wrapped around a schema to modify it. With our new <Link href="/api/pipe/">`pipe`</Link> method, this is no longer necessary. Instead, <Link href="/api/brand/">`brand`</Link> and <Link href="/api/transform/">`transform`</Link> are now transformation actions that can be placed directly in a pipeline, resulting in better readability, especially for complex schemas.

```ts
// Change this
const BrandedSchema = v.brand(v.string(), 'foo');
const TransformedSchema = v.transform(v.string(), (input) => input.length);

// To this
const BrandedSchema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.brand('foo'));
const TransformedSchema = v.pipe(
  v.string(),
  v.transform((input) => input.length)
);
```

##### Coerce method

The `coerce` method has been removed because we felt it was an insecure API. In most cases, you don't want to coerce an unknown input into a specific data type. Instead, you want to transform a specific data type into another specific data type. For example, a string or a number into a date. To explicitly define the input type, we recommend using the new <Link href="/api/pipe/">`pipe`</Link> method together with the <Link href="/api/transform/">`transform`</Link> action to achieve the same functionality.

```ts
// Change this
const DateSchema = v.coerce(v.date(), (input) => new Date(input));

// To this
const DateSchema = v.pipe(
  v.union([v.string(), v.number()]),
  v.transform((input) => new Date(input))
);
```

##### Flatten issues

Previously, the <Link href="/api/flatten/">`flatten`</Link> function accepted a <Link href="/api/ValiError/">`ValiError`</Link> or an array of issues. We have simplified the implementation by only allowing an array of issues to be passed.

```ts
// Change this
const flatErrors = v.flatten(error);

// To this
const flatErrors = v.flatten(error.issues);
```

### Migrate from Zod

Migrating from [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to Valibot is very easy in most cases since both APIs have a lot of similarities. The following guide will help you migrate step by step and also point out important differences.

#### Official codemod

To make the migration as smoth as possible, we have created an official codemod that automatically migrates your Zod schemas to Valibot. Just copy your schemas into this editor and click play.

> The codemod is still in beta and may not cover all edge cases. If you encounter any problems or unexpected behaviour, please create an [issue](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/issues/new). Alternatively, you can try to fix any issues yourself and create a [pull request](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/pulls). You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/tree/main/codemod/zod-to-valibot).

<CodemodEditor />

You will soon be able to also run the codemod locally in your terminal to migrate your entire codebase at once. Stay tuned!

#### Replace imports

The first thing to do after <Link href="../installation/">installing</Link> Valibot is to update your imports. Just change your Zod imports to Valibot's and replace all occurrences of `z.` with `v.`.

```ts
// Change this
import { z } from 'zod';
const Schema = z.object({ key: z.string() });

// To this
import * as v from 'valibot';
const Schema = v.object({ key: v.string() });
```

#### Restructure code

One of the biggest differences between Zod and Valibot is the way you further validate a given type. In Zod, you chain methods like `.email` and `.endsWith`. In Valibot you use <Link href="../pipelines/">pipelines</Link> to do the same thing. This is a function that starts with a schema and is followed by up to 19 validation or transformation actions.

```ts
// Change this
const Schema = z.string().email().endsWith('@example.com');

// To this
const Schema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.email(), v.endsWith('@example.com'));
```

Due to the modular design of Valibot, also all other methods like `.parse` or `.safeParse` have to be used a little bit differently. Instead of chaining them, you usually pass the schema as the first argument and move any existing arguments one position to the right.

```ts
// Change this
const value = z.string().parse('foo');

// To this
const value = v.parse(v.string(), 'foo');
```

We recommend that you read our <Link href="../mental-model/">mental model</Link> guide to understand how the individual functions of Valibot's modular API work together.

#### Change names

Most of the names are the same as in Zod. However, there are some exceptions. The following table shows all names that have changed.

| Zod                  | Valibot                                                                                                                                     |

#### Other details

Below are some more details that may be helpful when migrating from Zod to Valibot.

##### Object and tuple

To specify whether objects or tuples should allow or prevent unknown values, Valibot uses different schema functions. Zod uses the methods `.passthrough`, `.strict`, `.strip`, `.catchall` and `.rest` instead. See the <Link href="../objects/">objects</Link> and <Link href="../arrays/">arrays</Link> guide for more details.

```ts
// Change this
const ObjectSchema = z.object({ key: z.string() }).strict();

// To this
const ObjectSchema = v.strictObject({ key: v.string() });
```

##### Error messages

For individual error messages, you can pass a string or an object to Zod. It also allows you to differentiate between an error message for "required" and "invalid_type". With Valibot you just pass a single string instead.

```ts
// Change this
const StringSchema = z
  .string({ invalid_type_error: 'Not a string' })
  .min(5, { message: 'Too short' });

// To this
const StringSchema = v.pipe(
  v.string('Not a string'),
  v.minLength(5, 'Too short')
);
```

##### Coerce type

To enforce primitive values, you can use a method of the `coerce` object in Zod. There is no such object or function in Valibot. Instead, you use a pipeline with a <Link href="/api/transform/">`transform`</Link> action as the second argument. This forces you to explicitly define the input, resulting in safer code.

```ts
// Change this
const NumberSchema = z.coerce.number();

// To this
const NumberSchema = v.pipe(v.unknown(), v.transform(Number));
```

Instead of <Link href="/api/unknown/">`unknown`</Link> as in the previous example, we usually recommend using a specific schema such as <Link href="/api/string/">`string`</Link> to improve type safety. This allows you, for example, to validate the formatting of the string with <Link href="/api/decimal/">`decimal`</Link> before transforming it to a number.

```ts
const NumberSchema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.decimal(), v.transform(Number));
```

##### Async validation

Similar to Zod, Valibot supports synchronous and asynchronous validation. However, the API is a little bit different. See the <Link href="../async-validation/">async guide</Link> for more details.

## Schemas (API)

### any

Creates an any schema.

> This schema function exists only for completeness and is not recommended in practice. Instead, <Link href="../unknown/">`unknown`</Link> should be used to accept unknown data.

```ts
const Schema = v.any();
```

### boolean

Creates a boolean schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.boolean<TMessage>(message);
```

#### Generics

- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `boolean` you can validate the data type of the input. If the input is not a boolean, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

> Instead of using a <Link href="../pipe/">`pipe`</Link> to force `true` or `false` as a value, in most cases it makes more sense to use <Link href="../literal/">`literal`</Link> for better typing.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `boolean` can be used.

##### Custom message

Boolean schema with a custom error message.

```ts
const BooleanSchema = v.boolean("A boolean is required");
```

### custom

Creates a custom schema.

> This schema function allows you to define a schema that matches a value based on a custom function. Use it whenever you need to define a schema that cannot be expressed using any of the other schema functions.

```ts
const Schema = v.custom<TInput, TMessage>(check, message);
```

#### Generics

- `TInput` <Property {...properties.TInput} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `check` <Property {...properties.check} />

### exactOptional

Creates an exact optional schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.exactOptional<TWrapped, TDefault>(wrapped, default_);
```

#### Generics

- `TWrapped` <Property {...properties.TWrapped} />
- `TDefault` <Property {...properties.TDefault} />

#### Parameters

- `wrapped` <Property {...properties.wrapped} />
- `default_` {/_ prettier-ignore _/}<Property {...properties.default\_} />

##### Explanation

With `exactOptional` the validation of your schema will pass missing object entries, and if you specify a `default_` input value, the schema will use it if the object entry is missing. For this reason, the output type may differ from the input type of the schema.

> The difference to <Link href="../optional/">`optional`</Link> is that this schema function follows the implementation of TypeScript's [`exactOptionalPropertyTypes` configuration](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#exactOptionalPropertyTypes) and only allows missing but not undefined object entries.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `exactOptional` can be used.

##### Exact optional object entries

Object schema with exact optional entries.

> By using a function as the `default_` parameter, the schema will return a new [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) instance each time the input is `undefined`.

```ts
const OptionalEntrySchema = v.object({
  key1: v.exactOptional(v.string()),
  key2: v.exactOptional(v.string(), "I'm the default!"),
  key3: v.exactOptional(v.date(), () => new Date()),
});
```

##### Unwrap exact optional schema

Use <Link href="../unwrap/">`unwrap`</Link> to undo the effect of `exactOptional`.

```ts
const OptionalNumberSchema = v.exactOptional(v.number());
const NumberSchema = v.unwrap(OptionalNumberSchema);
```

### lazy

Creates a lazy schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.lazy<TWrapped>(getter);
```

#### Generics

- `TWrapped` <Property {...properties.TWrapped} />

#### Parameters

- `getter` <Property {...properties.getter} />

##### Explanation

The `getter` function is called lazily to retrieve the schema. This is necessary to be able to access the input through the first argument of the `getter` function and to avoid a circular dependency for recursive schemas.

> Due to a TypeScript limitation, the input and output types of recursive schemas cannot be inferred automatically. Therefore, you must explicitly specify these types using <Link href="/api/GenericSchema/">`GenericSchema`</Link>. Please see the examples below.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `lazy` can be used.

##### Binary tree schema

Recursive schema to validate a binary tree.

```ts
type BinaryTree = {
  element: string;
  left: BinaryTree | null;
  right: BinaryTree | null;
};

const BinaryTreeSchema: v.GenericSchema<BinaryTree> = v.object({
  element: v.string(),
  left: v.nullable(v.lazy(() => BinaryTreeSchema)),
  right: v.nullable(v.lazy(() => BinaryTreeSchema)),
});
```

##### JSON data schema

Schema to validate all possible `JSON` values.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

type JsonData =
  | string
  | number
  | boolean
  | null
  | { [key: string]: JsonData }
  | JsonData[];

const JsonSchema: v.GenericSchema<JsonData> = v.lazy(() =>
  v.union([
    v.string(),
    v.number(),
    v.boolean(),
    v.null(),
    v.record(v.string(), JsonSchema),
    v.array(JsonSchema),
  ])
);
```

##### Lazy union schema

Schema to validate a discriminated union of objects.

> In most cases, <Link href="/api/union/">`union`</Link> and <Link href="/api/variant/">`variant`</Link> are the better choices for creating such a schema. I recommend using `lazy` only in special cases.

```ts
const LazyUnionSchema = v.lazy((input) => {
  if (input && typeof input === "object" && "type" in input) {
    switch (input.type) {
      case "email":

### nullable

Creates a nullable schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.nullable<TWrapped, TDefault>(wrapped, default_);
```

#### Generics

- `TWrapped` <Property {...properties.TWrapped} />
- `TDefault` <Property {...properties.TDefault} />

#### Parameters

- `wrapped` <Property {...properties.wrapped} />
- `default_` {/_ prettier-ignore _/}<Property {...properties.default\_} />

##### Explanation

With `nullable` the validation of your schema will pass `null` inputs, and if you specify a `default_` input value, the schema will use it if the input is `null`. For this reason, the output type may differ from the input type of the schema.

> Note that `nullable` does not accept `undefined` as an input. If you want to accept `undefined` inputs, use <Link href="../optional/">`optional`</Link>, and if you want to accept `null` and `undefined` inputs, use <Link href="../nullish/">`nullish`</Link> instead. Also, if you want to set a default output value for any invalid input, you should use <Link href="../fallback/">`fallback`</Link> instead.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `nullable` can be used.

##### Nullable string schema

Schema that accepts `string` and `null`.

```ts
const NullableStringSchema = v.nullable(v.string(), "I'm the default!");
```

##### Nullable date schema

Schema that accepts [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) and `null`.

> By using a function as the `default_` parameter, the schema will return a new [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) instance each time the input is `null`.

```ts
const NullableDateSchema = v.nullable(v.date(), () => new Date());
```

##### Nullable entry schema

Object schema with a nullable entry.

```ts
const NullableEntrySchema = v.object({
  key: v.nullable(v.string()),
});
```

##### Unwrap nullable schema

Use <Link href="../unwrap/">`unwrap`</Link> to undo the effect of `nullable`.

```ts
const NullableNumberSchema = v.nullable(v.number());
const NumberSchema = v.unwrap(NullableNumberSchema);
```

### nullish

Creates a nullish schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.nullish<TWrapped, TDefault>(wrapped, default_);
```

#### Generics

- `TWrapped` <Property {...properties.TWrapped} />
- `TDefault` <Property {...properties.TDefault} />

#### Parameters

- `wrapped` <Property {...properties.wrapped} />
- `default_` {/_ prettier-ignore _/}<Property {...properties.default\_} />

##### Explanation

With `nullish` the validation of your schema will pass `undefined` and `null` inputs, and if you specify a `default_` input value, the schema will use it if the input is `undefined` or `null`. For this reason, the output type may differ from the input type of the schema.

> Note that `nullish` accepts `undefined` and `null` as an input. If you want to accept only `null` inputs, use <Link href="../nullable/">`nullable`</Link>, and if you want to accept only `undefined` inputs, use <Link href="../optional/">`optional`</Link> instead. Also, if you want to set a default output value for any invalid input, you should use <Link href="../fallback/">`fallback`</Link> instead.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `nullish` can be used.

> By using a function as the `default_` parameter, the schema will return a new [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) instance each time the input is `undefined` or `null`.

```ts
const NullishDateSchema = v.nullish(v.date(), () => new Date());
```

##### Nullish entry schema

Object schema with a nullish entry.

```ts
const NullishEntrySchema = v.object({
  key: v.nullish(v.string()),
});

> Note that `optional` does not accept `null` as an input. If you want to accept `null` inputs, use <Link href="../nullable/">`nullable`</Link>, and if you want to accept `null` and `undefined` inputs, use <Link href="../nullish/">`nullish`</Link> instead. Also, if you want to set a default output value for any invalid input, you should use <Link href="../fallback/">`fallback`</Link> instead.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

##### Explanation

With `picklist` you can validate that the input corresponds to a picklist option. If the input is invalid, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

> `picklist` works in a similar way to <Link href="../enum/">`enum`</Link>. However, in many cases it is easier to use because you can pass an array of values instead of an enum.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `picklist` can be used.

##### Language schema

Schema to validate programming languages.

```ts
const LanguageSchema = v.picklist(["JavaScript", "TypeScript"]);

- `value` <Property {...properties.value} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `record` you can validate the data type of the input and whether the entries matches `key` and `value`. If the input is not an object, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

> This schema filters certain entries from the record for security reasons.

> This schema marks an entry as optional if it detects that its key is a literal type. The reason for this is that it is not technically possible to detect missing literal keys without restricting the `key` schema to <Link href="../string/">`string`</Link>, <Link href="../enum/">`enum`</Link> and <Link href="../picklist/">`picklist`</Link>. However, if <Link href="../enum/">`enum`</Link> and <Link href="../picklist/">`picklist`</Link> are used, it is better to use <Link href="../object/">`object`</Link> with <Link href="../entriesFromList/">`entriesFromList`</Link> because it already covers the needed functionality. This decision also reduces the bundle size of `record`, because it only needs to check the entries of the input and not any missing keys.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `record` can be used.

##### String record schema

Schema to validate a record with strings.

```ts
const StringRecordSchema = v.record(
  v.string(),
  v.string(),
  "An object is required."
);
```

##### Object record schema

Schema to validate a record of objects.

```ts
const ObjectRecordSchema = v.record(v.string(), v.object({ key: v.string() }));
```

##### Picklist as key

Schema to validate a record with specific optional keys.

```ts
const ProductRecordSchema = v.record(
  v.picklist(["product_a", "product_b", "product_c"]),
  v.optional(v.number())
);
```

##### Enum as key

Schema to validate a record with specific optional keys.

```ts
enum Products {
  PRODUCT_A = "product_a",
  PRODUCT_B = "product_b",
  PRODUCT_C = "product_c",
}

const ProductRecordSchema = v.record(v.enum(Products), v.optional(v.number()));
```

- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `entries` <Property {...properties.entries} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `strictObject` you can validate the data type of the input and whether the content matches `entries`. If the input is not an object or does include unknown entries, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

> The difference to <Link href="../object/">`object`</Link> is that this schema returns an issue for unknown entries. It intentionally returns only one issue. Otherwise, attackers could send large objects to exhaust device resources. If you want an issue for every unknown key, use the <Link href="../objectWithRest/">`objectWithRest`</Link> schema with <Link href="../never/">`never`</Link> for the `rest` argument.

#### Returns

```ts
const PickObjectSchema = v.pick(
  v.strictObject({
    key1: v.string(),
    key2: v.number(),
    key3: v.boolean(),

##### Explanation

With `undefinedable` the validation of your schema will pass `undefined` inputs, and if you specify a `default_` input value, the schema will use it if the input is `undefined`. For this reason, the output type may differ from the input type of the schema.

> `undefinedable` behaves exactly the same as <Link href="../optional/">`optional`</Link> at runtime. The only difference is the input and output type when used for object entries. While <Link href="../optional/">`optional`</Link> adds a question mark to the key, `undefinedable` does not.

> Note that `undefinedable` does not accept `null` as an input. If you want to accept `null` inputs, use <Link href="../nullable/">`nullable`</Link>, and if you want to accept `null` and `undefined` inputs, use <Link href="../nullish/">`nullish`</Link> instead. Also, if you want to set a default output value for any invalid input, you should use <Link href="../fallback/">`fallback`</Link> instead.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `undefinedable` can be used.

##### Undefinedable string schema

Schema that accepts `string` and `undefined`.

```ts
const UndefinedableStringSchema = v.undefinedable(
  v.string(),
  "I'm the default!"
);
```

##### Undefinedable date schema

Schema that accepts [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) and `undefined`.

> By using a function as the `default_` parameter, the schema will return a new [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) instance each time the input is `undefined`.

```ts
const UndefinedableDateSchema = v.undefinedable(v.date(), () => new Date());
```

##### Undefinedable entry schema

Object schema with an undefinedable entry.

```ts
const UndefinedableEntrySchema = v.object({
  key: v.undefinedable(v.string()),
});
```

##### Unwrap undefinedable schema

Use <Link href="../unwrap/">`unwrap`</Link> to undo the effect of `undefinedable`.

```ts
const UndefinedableNumberSchema = v.undefinedable(v.number());
const NumberSchema = v.unwrap(UndefinedableNumberSchema);
```

### union

Creates an union schema.

> I recommend that you read the <Link href="/guides/unions/">unions guide</Link> before using this schema function.

```ts
const Schema = v.union<TOptions, TMessage>(options, message);
```

#### Generics

- `TOptions` <Property {...properties.TOptions} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `options` <Property {...properties.options} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `union` you can validate if the input matches one of the given `options`. If the input does not match a schema and cannot be clearly assigned to one of the options, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

If a bad input can be uniquely assigned to one of the schemas based on the data type, the result of that schema is returned. Otherwise, a general issue is returned that contains the issues of each schema as subissues. This is a special case within the library, as the issues of `union` can contradict each other.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `union` can be used.

##### URL schema

Schema to validate an URL or empty string.

```ts
const UrlSchema = v.union([v.pipe(v.string(), v.url()), v.literal("")]);
```

##### Number schema

Schema to validate a number or decimal string.

```ts
const NumberSchema = v.union([v.number(), v.pipe(v.string(), v.decimal())]);
```

##### Date schema

Schema to validate a `Date` or ISO timestamp.

```ts
const DateSchema = v.union([v.date(), v.pipe(v.string(), v.isoTimestamp())]);
```

### variant

Creates a variant schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.variant<TKey, TOptions, TMessage>(key, options, message);
```

#### Generics

- `TKey` <Property {...properties.TKey} />
- `TOptions` <Property {...properties.TOptions} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `key` <Property {...properties.key} />
- `options` <Property {...properties.options} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `variant` you can validate if the input matches one of the given object `options`. The object schema to be used for the validation is determined by the discriminator `key`. If the input does not match a schema and cannot be clearly assigned to one of the options, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

> It is allowed to specify the exact same or a similar discriminator multiple times. However, in such cases `variant` will only return the output of the first untyped or typed variant option result. Typed results take precedence over untyped ones.

> For deeply nested `variant` schemas with several different discriminator keys, `variant` will return an issue for the first most likely object schemas on invalid input. The order of the discriminator keys and the presence of a discriminator in the input are taken into account.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `variant` can be used.

##### Variant schema

Schema to validate an email, URL or date variant.

```ts
const VariantSchema = v.variant("type", [
  v.object({
    type: v.literal("email"),
    email: v.pipe(v.string(), v.email()),
  }),
  v.object({
    type: v.literal("url"),
    url: v.pipe(v.string(), v.url()),
  }),
  v.object({
    type: v.literal("date"),
    date: v.pipe(v.string(), v.isoDate()),
  }),
]);
```

##### Nested variant schema

You can also nest `variant` schemas.

```ts
const NestedVariantSchema = v.variant("type", [
  VariantSchema,
  v.object({
    type: v.literal("color"),
    date: v.pipe(v.string(), v.hexColor()),
  }),
]);
```

##### Complex variant schema

You can also use `variant` to validate complex objects with multiple different discriminator keys.

```ts
const ComplexVariantSchema = v.variant('kind', [
  v.variant('type', [
    v.object({
      kind: v.literal('fruit'),
      type: v.literal('apple'),
      item: v.object({ … }),
    }),
    v.object({
      kind: v.literal('fruit'),
      type: v.literal('banana'),
      item: v.object({ … }),
    }),
  ]),
  v.variant('type', [
    v.object({
      kind: v.literal('vegetable'),
      type: v.literal('carrot'),
      item: v.object({ … }),
    }),
    v.object({
      kind: v.literal('vegetable'),
      type: v.literal('tomato'),
      item: v.object({ … }),
    }),
  ]),
]);
```

#### Parameters

- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

## Methods (API)

### assert

Checks if the input matches the scheme.

> As this is an assertion function, it can be used as a type guard.

```ts
v.assert<TSchema>(schema, input);
```

#### Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />

#### Parameters

- `schema` <Property {...properties.schema} />
- `input` <Property {...properties.input} />

##### Explanation

`assert` does not modify the `input`. Therefore, transformations have no effect and unknown keys of an object are not removed. That is why this approach is not as safe and powerful as <Link href='../parse/'>`parse`</Link> and <Link href='../safeParse/'>`safeParse`</Link>.

#### Example

The following example show how `assert` can be used.

```ts
const EmailSchema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.email());
const data: unknown = "jane@example.com";

v.assert(EmailSchema, data);
const email = data; // string
```

### config

Changes the local configuration of a schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.config<TSchema>(schema, config);
```

#### Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />

#### Parameters

- `schema` <Property {...properties.schema} />
- `config` <Property {...properties.config} />

##### Explanation

This method overwrites the selected configuration properties by merging the previous configuration of the `schema` with the provided `config`.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `config` can be used.

##### Same error message

Schema that uses the same error message for the entire pipeline.

```ts
const Schema = v.object({
  email: v.config(
    v.pipe(v.string(), v.trim(), v.email(), v.endsWith("@example.com")),
    { message: "The email does not conform to the required format." }
  ),
  // ...
});
```

##### Abort pipeline early

Schema that aborts only a specific pipeline early.

```ts
const Schema = v.object({
  url: v.config(
    v.pipe(v.string(), v.trim(), v.url(), v.endsWith("@example.com")),

### fallback

Returns a fallback value as output if the input does not match the schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.fallback<TSchema, TFallback>(schema, fallback);
```

#### Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />
- `TFallback` <Property {...properties.TFallback} />

#### Parameters

- `schema` <Property {...properties.schema} />
- `fallback` <Property {...properties.fallback} />

##### Explanation

`fallback` allows you to define a fallback value for the output that will be used if the validation of the input fails. This means that no issues will be returned when using `fallback` and the schema will always return an output.

> If you only want to set a default value for `null` or `undefined` inputs, you should use <Link href="../optional/">`optional`</Link>, <Link href="../nullable/">`nullable`</Link> or <Link href="../nullish/">`nullish`</Link> instead.

> The fallback value is not validated. Make sure that the fallback value matches your schema.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `fallback` can be used.

##### Fallback string schema

Schema that will always return a string output.

```ts
const FallbackStringSchema = v.fallback(v.string(), "I'm the fallback!");
```

##### Fallback date schema

Schema that will always return a [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) output.

> By using a function as the `fallback` parameter, the schema will return a new [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) instance each time the input does not match the schema.

```ts
const FallbackDateSchema = v.fallback(v.date(), () => new Date());
```

### flatten

Flatten the error messages of issues.

```ts
const errors = v.flatten<TSchema>(issues);
```

#### Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />

#### Parameters

- `issues` <Property {...properties.issues} />

##### Explanation

The error messages of issues without a path that belong to the root of the schema are added to the `.root` key.

The error messages of issues with a path that belong to the nested parts of the schema and can be converted to a dot path are added to the `.nested` key.

Some issue paths, for example for complex data types like `Set` and `Map`, have no key or a key that cannot be converted to a dot path. These error messages are added to the `.other` key.

#### Returns

- `errors` <Property {...properties.errors} />

#### Examples

The following example show how `flatten` can be used.

```ts
const Schema = v.object({
  nested: v.object({
    foo: v.string('Value of "nested.foo" is invalid.'),
  }),
});

const result = v.safeParse(Schema, { nested: { foo: null } });

if (result.issues) {
  const flatErrors = v.flatten<typeof Schema>(result.issues);

  // ...
}
```

```ts
const Action = v.forward<TInput, TIssue, TPath>(action, path);
```

#### Generics

- `TInput` <Property {...properties.TInput} />
- `TIssue` <Property {...properties.TIssue} />
- `TPath` <Property {...properties.TPath} />

#### Parameters

- `action` <Property {...properties.action} />
- `path` <Property {...properties.path} />

##### Explanation

`forward` allows you to forward the issues of the passed validation `action` via `path` to a nested field of a schema.

#### Returns

- `Action` <Property {...properties.Action} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `forward` can be used.

##### Register schema

Schema that ensures that the two passwords match.

```ts
const RegisterSchema = v.pipe(
  v.object({
    email: v.pipe(
      v.string(),
      v.nonEmpty("Please enter your email."),
      v.email("The email address is badly formatted.")
    ),
    password1: v.pipe(
      v.string(),
      v.nonEmpty("Please enter your password."),
      v.minLength(8, "Your password must have 8 characters or more.")
    ),
    password2: v.string(),
  }),
  v.forward(
    v.partialCheck(
      [["password1"], ["password2"]],
      (input) => input.password1 === input.password2,
      "The two passwords do not match."

#### Returns

- `title` <Property {...properties.title} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `getTitle` can be used.

##### Get title of schema

```ts
const UsernameSchema = v.pipe(
  v.string(),
  v.regex(/^[a-z0-9_-]{4,16}$/iu),
  v.title("Username"),
  v.description(
    "A username must be between 4 and 16 characters long and can only contain letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens."
  )
);

const title = v.getTitle(UsernameSchema); // 'Username'
```

### is

Checks if the input matches the scheme.

> By using a type predicate, this function can be used as a type guard.

```ts
const result = v.is<TSchema>(schema, input);
```

#### Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />

#### Parameters

- `schema` <Property {...properties.schema} />
- `input` <Property {...properties.input} />

##### Explanation

`is` does not modify the `input`. Therefore, transformations have no effect and unknown keys of an object are not removed. That is why this approach is not as safe and powerful as <Link href='../parse/'>`parse`</Link> and <Link href='../safeParse/'>`safeParse`</Link>.

#### Returns

- `result` <Property {...properties.result} />

#### Example

The following example show how `is` can be used.

```ts
const EmailSchema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.email());
const data: unknown = "jane@example.com";

if (v.is(EmailSchema, data)) {
  const email = data; // string
}

### message

Changes the local message configuration of a schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.message<TSchema>(schema, message_);
```

#### Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />

#### Parameters

- `schema` <Property {...properties.schema} />
- `message_` <Property {...properties['message_']} />

##### Explanation

This method overrides the local message configuration of the schema. In practice, it is typically used to specify a single error message for an entire pipeline.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `message` can be used.

##### Email schema

Email schema that uses the same error message for the entire pipeline.

```ts
const EmailSchema = v.message(
  v.pipe(v.string(), v.trim(), v.nonEmpty(), v.email(), v.maxLength(100)),
  "The email is not in the required format."

### omit

Creates a modified copy of an object schema that does not contain the selected entries.

```ts
const Schema = v.omit<TSchema, TKeys>(schema, keys);
```

#### Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />
- `TKeys` <Property {...properties.TKeys} />

#### Parameters

- `schema` <Property {...properties.schema} />
- `keys` <Property {...properties.keys} />

##### Explanation

`omit` creates a modified copy of the given object `schema` that does not contain the selected `keys`. It is similar to TypeScript's [`Omit`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#omittype-keys) utility type.

> Because `omit` changes the data type of the input and output, it is not allowed to pass a schema that has been modified by the <Link href='../pipe/'>`pipe`</Link> method, as this may cause runtime errors. Please use the <Link href='../pipe/'>`pipe`</Link> method after you have modified the schema with `omit`.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `omit` can be used.

##### Omit specific keys

Schema that does not contain the selected keys of an existing schema.

```ts
const OmittedSchema = v.omit(
  v.object({
    key1: v.string(),
    key2: v.number(),
    key3: v.boolean(),
  }),
  ["key1", "key3"]
); // { key2: number }

### parse

Parses an unknown input based on a schema.

```ts
const output = v.parse<TSchema>(schema, input, config);
```

#### Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />

#### Parameters

- `schema` <Property {...properties.schema} />
- `input` <Property {...properties.input} />
- `config` <Property {...properties.config} />

##### Explanation

`parse` will throw a <Link href="../ValiError/">`ValiError`</Link> if the `input` does not match the `schema`. Therefore you should use a try/catch block to catch errors. If the input matches the schema, it is valid and the `output` of the schema will be returned typed.

#### Returns

- `output` <Property {...properties.output} />

#### Example

The following example show how `parse` can be used.

```ts
try {
  const EmailSchema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.email());
  const email = v.parse(EmailSchema, "jane@example.com");

  // Handle errors if one occurs
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}

### pipe

Adds a pipeline to a schema, that can validate and transform its input.

```ts
const Schema = v.pipe<TSchema, TItems>(schema, ...items);
```

#### Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />
- `TItems` <Property {...properties.TItems} />

#### Parameters

- `schema` <Property {...properties.schema} />
- `items` <Property {...properties.items} />

##### Explanation

`pipe` creates a modified copy of the given `schema`, containing a pipeline for detailed validations and transformations. It passes the input data synchronously through the `items` in the order they are provided and each item can examine and modify it.

> Since `pipe` returns a schema that can be used as the first argument of another pipeline, it is possible to nest multiple `pipe` calls to extend the validation and transformation further.

The `pipe` aborts early and marks the output as untyped if issues were collected before attempting to execute a schema or transformation action as the next item in the pipeline, to prevent unexpected behavior.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `pipe` can be used. Please see the <Link href="/guides/pipelines/">pipeline guide</Link> for more examples and explanations.

##### Email schema

Schema to validate an email.

```ts
const EmailSchema = v.pipe(
  v.string(),
  v.nonEmpty("Please enter your email."),
  v.email("The email is badly formatted."),
  v.maxLength(30, "Your email is too long.")
);
```

##### String to number

Schema to convert a string to a number.

```ts
const NumberSchema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.transform(Number), v.number());
```

const OrderIdSchema = v.pipe(v.string(), v.flavor("OrderId"));

// Infer output types of both schemas
type UserId = v.InferOutput<typeof UserIdSchema>;
type OrderId = v.InferOutput<typeof OrderIdSchema>;

// This works because output is flavored
const userId: UserId = v.parse(UserIdSchema, "c28443ef...");
const orderId: OrderId = v.parse(OrderIdSchema, "4b717520...");

// You can also use unflavored strings
const newUserId1: UserId = "2d80cd94...";

// But this will result in a type error
const newUserId2: UserId = orderId;
```

### checkAsync

Creates a check validation action.

```ts
const Action = v.checkAsync<TInput, TMessage>(requirement, message);
```

#### Generics

- `TInput` <Property {...properties.TInput} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `requirement` <Property {...properties.requirement} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `checkAsync` you can freely validate the input and return `true` if it is valid or `false` otherwise. If the input does not match your `requirement`, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

#### Returns

- `Action` <Property {...properties.Action} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `checkAsync` can be used.

##### Cart item schema

Schema to check a cart item object.

```ts
import { getProductItem } from "~/api";

const CartItemSchema = v.pipeAsync(
  v.object({
    itemId: v.pipe(v.string(), v.regex(/^[a-z0-9]{10}$/i)),
    quantity: v.pipe(v.number(), v.minValue(1)),
  }),
  v.checkAsync(async (input) => {
    const productItem = await getProductItem(input.itemId);
    return productItem?.quantity >= input.quantity;
  }, "The required quantity is greater than available.")
);
```

### checkItemsAsync

Creates a check items validation action.

```ts
const Action = v.checkItemsAsync<TInput, TMessage>(requirement, message);
```

#### Generics

- `TInput` <Property {...properties.TInput} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `requirement` <Property {...properties.requirement} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `checkItemsAsync` you can freely validate the items of an array and return `true` if they are valid or `false` otherwise. If an item does not match your `requirement`, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

> The special thing about `checkItemsAsync` is that it automatically forwards each issue to the appropriate item.

#### Returns

- `Action` <Property {...properties.Action} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `checkItemsAsync` can be used.

##### Cart items schema

Schema to check an array of cart item objects.

```ts
import { getProductItem } from "~/api";

const CartItemsSchema = v.pipeAsync(
  v.array(
    v.object({
      itemId: v.pipe(v.string(), v.uuid()),
      quantity: v.pipe(v.number(), v.minValue(1)),
    })
  ),
  v.checkItemsAsync(async (input) => {
    const productItem = await getProductItem(input.itemId);
    return (productItem?.quantity ?? 0) >= input.quantity;
  }, "The required quantity is greater than available.")
);

### customAsync

Creates a custom schema.

> This schema function allows you to define a schema that matches a value based on a custom function. Use it whenever you need to define a schema that cannot be expressed using any of the other schema functions.

```ts
const Schema = v.customAsync<TInput, TMessage>(check, message);
```

#### Generics

- `TInput` <Property {...properties.TInput} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `check` <Property {...properties.check} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `customAsync` you can validate the data type of the input. If the input does not match the validation of `check`, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

> Make sure that the validation in `check` matches the data type of `TInput`.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `customAsync` can be used.

##### Vacant seat schema

Schema to validate a vacant seat.

```ts
import { isSeatVacant } from "~/api";

type Group = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E";
type DigitLessThanSix = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5";
type Digit = DigitLessThanSix | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9";
type Seat = `${Group}${DigitLessThanSix}${Digit}`;

function isSeat(possibleSeat: string): possibleSeat is Seat {
  return /^[A-E][0-5]\d$/.test(possibleSeat);
}

const VacantSeatSchema = v.customAsync<Seat>(
  (input) => typeof input === "string" && isSeat(input) && isSeatVacant(input),

### exactOptionalAsync

Creates an exact optional schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.exactOptionalAsync<TWrapped, TDefault>(wrapped, default_);
```

#### Generics

- `TWrapped` <Property {...properties.TWrapped} />
- `TDefault` <Property {...properties.TDefault} />

#### Parameters

- `wrapped` <Property {...properties.wrapped} />
- `default_` {/_ prettier-ignore _/}<Property {...properties.default\_} />

##### Explanation

With `exactOptionalAsync` the validation of your schema will pass missing object entries, and if you specify a `default_` input value, the schema will use it if the object entry is missing. For this reason, the output type may differ from the input type of the schema.

> The difference to <Link href="../optionalAsync/">`optionalAsync`</Link> is that this schema function follows the implementation of TypeScript's [`exactOptionalPropertyTypes` configuration](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#exactOptionalPropertyTypes) and only allows missing but not undefined object entries.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `exactOptionalAsync` can be used.

##### New user schema

Schema to validate new user details.

```ts
import { isEmailUnique, isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const NewUserSchema = v.objectAsync({
  email: v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.email(),
    v.checkAsync(isEmailUnique, "The email is not unique.")
  ),
  username: v.exactOptionalAsync(
    v.pipeAsync(
      v.string(),
      v.nonEmpty(),
      v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique, "The username is not unique.")
    )
  ),
  password: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(8)),
});

/*
  The input and output types of the schema:
    {
      email: string;
      password: string;
      username?: string;
    }
*/
```

##### Unwrap exact optional schema

Use <Link href="../unwrap/">`unwrap`</Link> to undo the effect of `exactOptionalAsync`.

```ts
import { isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const UsernameSchema = v.unwrap(
  // Assume this schema is from a different file and is reused here
  v.exactOptionalAsync(
    v.pipeAsync(
      v.string(),
      v.nonEmpty(),
      v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique, "The username is not unique.")
    )
  )
);
```

### fallbackAsync

Returns a fallback value as output if the input does not match the schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.fallbackAsync<TSchema, TFallback>(schema, fallback);
```

#### Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />
- `TFallback` <Property {...properties.TFallback} />

#### Parameters

- `schema` <Property {...properties.schema} />
- `fallback` <Property {...properties.fallback} />

##### Explanation

`fallbackAsync` allows you to define a fallback value for the output that will be used if the validation of the input fails. This means that no issues will be returned when using `fallbackAsync` and the schema will always return an output.

> If you only want to set a default value for `null` or `undefined` inputs, you should use <Link href="../optionalAsync/">`optionalAsync`</Link>, <Link href="../nullableAsync/">`nullableAsync`</Link> or <Link href="../nullishAsync/">`nullishAsync`</Link> instead.

> The fallback value is not validated. Make sure that the fallback value matches your schema.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `fallbackAsync` can be used.

##### Unique username schema

Schema that will always return a unique username.

> By using a function as the `fallbackAsync` parameter, the schema will return any unique username each time the input does not match the schema.

```ts
import { getAnyUniqueUsername, isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const UniqueUsernameSchema = v.fallbackAsync(
  v.pipeAsync(v.string(), v.minLength(4), v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique)),
  getAnyUniqueUsername
);
```

const AllowedActionSchema = v.pipeAsync(
  v.objectAsync({
    username: v.pipeAsync(
      v.string(),
      v.minLength(3),
      v.checkAsync(isUsernamePresent, "The username is not in the database.")

  organizationId: v.optionalAsync(v.pipe(v.string(), v.uuid()), getRandomOrgId),
  message: v.optional(v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(1))),
});

const defaultValues = await v.getDefaultsAsync(DonationSchema);

/*

### getFallbacksAsync

Returns the fallback values of the schema.

> The difference to <Link href='../getFallback/'>`getFallback`</Link> is that for object and tuple schemas this function recursively returns the fallback values of the subschemas instead of `undefined`.

```ts
const values = v.getFallbacksAsync<TSchema>(schema);
```

#### Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />

#### Parameters

- `schema` <Property {...properties.schema} />

#### Returns

- `values` <Property {...properties.values} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `getFallbacksAsync` can be used.

##### New user fallbacks

Get the fallback values of a new user schema.

```ts
import { getAnyUniqueUsername, isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const NewUserSchema = v.objectAsync({
  username: v.fallbackAsync(
    v.pipeAsync(v.string(), v.minLength(3), v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique)),
    getAnyUniqueUsername
  ),
  password: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(8)),
});

const fallbackValues = await v.getFallbacksAsync(NewUserSchema);
/*
  {
    username: "cookieMonster07",
    password: undefined
  }
*/
```

### intersectAsync

Creates an intersect schema.

> I recommend to read the <Link href="/guides/intersections/">intersections guide</Link> before using this schema function.

```ts
const Schema = v.intersectAsync<TOptions, TMessage>(options, message);
```

#### Generics

- `TOptions` <Property {...properties.TOptions} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `options` <Property {...properties.options} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `intersectAsync` you can validate if the input matches each of the given `options`. If the output of the intersection cannot be successfully merged, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `intersectAsync` can be used.

##### Donation schema

Schema that combines objects to validate donation details.

```ts
import { isOrganizationPresent } from "~/api";

const DonationSchema = v.intersectAsync([
  v.objectAsync({
    organizationId: v.pipeAsync(
      v.string(),
      v.uuid(),
      v.checkAsync(
        isOrganizationPresent,
        "The organization is not in the database."
      )
    ),
  }),
  // Assume the schemas below are from different files and are reused here
  v.object({
    amount: v.pipe(v.number(), v.minValue(100)),
    message: v.pipe(v.string(), v.nonEmpty()),
  }),
  v.object({
    amount: v.pipe(v.number(), v.maxValue(1_000_000)),
    message: v.pipe(v.string(), v.maxLength(500)),
  }),
]);

### lazyAsync

Creates a lazy schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.lazyAsync<TWrapped>(getter);
```

#### Generics

- `TWrapped` <Property {...properties.TWrapped} />

#### Parameters

- `getter` <Property {...properties.getter} />

##### Explanation

The `getter` function is called lazily to retrieve the schema. This is necessary to be able to access the input through the first argument of the `getter` function and to avoid a circular dependency for recursive schemas.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `lazyAsync` can be used.

##### Transaction list schema

Recursive schema to validate transactions.

> Due to a TypeScript limitation, the input and output types of recursive schemas cannot be inferred automatically. Therefore, you must explicitly specify these types using <Link href="/api/GenericSchemaAsync/">`GenericSchemaAsync`</Link>.

```ts
import { isTransactionValid } from "~/api";

type Transaction = {
  transactionId: string;
  next: Transaction | null;
};

const TransactionSchema: v.GenericSchemaAsync<Transaction> = v.objectAsync({
  transactionId: v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.uuid(),
    v.checkAsync(isTransactionValid, "The transaction is not valid.")
  ),
  next: v.nullableAsync(v.lazyAsync(() => TransactionSchema)),
});
```

##### Email or username schema

Schema to validate an object containing an email or username.

> In most cases, <Link href="/api/unionAsync/">`unionAsync`</Link> and <Link href="/api/variantAsync/">`variantAsync`</Link> are the better choices for creating such a schema. I recommend using `lazyAsync` only in special cases.

```ts
import { isEmailPresent, isUsernamePresent } from "~/api";

const EmailOrUsernameSchema = v.lazyAsync((input) => {
  if (input && typeof input === "object" && "type" in input) {
    switch (input.type) {
      case "email":
        return v.objectAsync({
          type: v.literal("email"),
          email: v.pipeAsync(
            v.string(),
            v.email(),
            v.checkAsync(
              isEmailPresent,
              "The email is not present in the database."
            )
          ),
        });
      case "username":
        return v.objectAsync({
          type: v.literal("username"),
          username: v.pipeAsync(
            v.string(),
            v.nonEmpty(),
            v.checkAsync(
              isUsernamePresent,
              "The username is not present in the database."
            )
          ),
        });
    }
  }
  return v.never();
});

### looseObjectAsync

Creates a loose object schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.looseObjectAsync<TEntries, TMessage>(entries, message);
```

#### Generics

- `TEntries` <Property {...properties.TEntries} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `entries` <Property {...properties.entries} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `looseObjectAsync` you can validate the data type of the input and whether the content matches `entries`. If the input is not an object, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

> The difference to <Link href="../objectAsync/">`objectAsync`</Link> is that this schema includes any unknown entries in the output. In addition, this schema filters certain entries from the unknown entries for security reasons.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `looseObjectAsync` can be used. Please see the <Link href="/guides/objects/">object guide</Link> for more examples and explanations.

##### New user schema

Schema to validate a loose object containing specific new user details.

```ts
import { isEmailPresent } from "~/api";

const NewUserSchema = v.looseObjectAsync({
  firstName: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(2), v.maxLength(45)),
  lastName: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(2), v.maxLength(45)),
  email: v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.email(),
    v.checkAsync(isEmailPresent, "The email is already in use by another user.")
  ),
  password: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(8)),
  avatar: v.optional(v.pipe(v.string(), v.url())),
});

### mapAsync

Creates a map schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.mapAsync<TKey, TValue, TMessage>(key, value, message);
```

#### Generics

- `TKey` <Property {...properties.TKey} />
- `TValue` <Property {...properties.TValue} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `key` <Property {...properties.key} />
- `value` <Property {...properties.value} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `mapAsync` you can validate the data type of the input and whether the entries match `key` and `value`. If the input is not a map, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `mapAsync` can be used.

##### Shopping items schema

Schema to validate a map with usernames that are allowed to shop as keys and the total items purchased as values.

```ts
import { isUserVerified } from "~/api";

const ShoppingItemsSchema = v.mapAsync(
  v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.checkAsync(isUserVerified, "The username is not allowed to shop.")
  ),
  v.pipe(v.number(), v.minValue(0))
);

### nonNullableAsync

Creates a non nullable schema.

> This schema function can be used to override the behavior of <Link href="../nullableAsync/">`nullableAsync`</Link>.

```ts
const Schema = v.nonNullableAsync<TWrapped, TMessage>(wrapped, message);
```

#### Generics

- `TWrapped` <Property {...properties.TWrapped} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `wrapped` <Property {...properties.wrapped} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `nonNullableAsync` the validation of your schema will not pass `null` inputs. If the input is `null`, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `nonNullableAsync` can be used.

##### Unique username schema

Schema to validate a non-null unique username.

```ts
import { isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const UniqueUsernameSchema = v.nonNullableAsync(
  // Assume this schema is from a different file and reused here.
  v.nullableAsync(
    v.pipeAsync(
      v.string(),
      v.nonEmpty(),
      v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique, "The username is not unique.")
    )
  )
);

### nullableAsync

Creates a nullable schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.nullableAsync<TWrapped, TDefault>(wrapped, default_);
```

#### Generics

- `TWrapped` <Property {...properties.TWrapped} />
- `TDefault` <Property {...properties.TDefault} />

#### Parameters

- `wrapped` <Property {...properties.wrapped} />
- `default_` {/_ prettier-ignore _/}<Property {...properties.default\_} />

##### Explanation

With `nullableAsync` the validation of your schema will pass `null` inputs, and if you specify a `default_` input value, the schema will use it if the input is `null`. For this reason, the output type may differ from the input type of the schema.

> Note that `nullableAsync` does not accept `undefined` as an input. If you want to accept `undefined` inputs, use <Link href="../optionalAsync/">`optionalAsync`</Link>, and if you want to accept `null` and `undefined` inputs, use <Link href="../nullishAsync/">`nullishAsync`</Link> instead. Also, if you want to set a default output value for any invalid input, you should use <Link href="../fallbackAsync/">`fallbackAsync`</Link> instead.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `nullableAsync` can be used.

##### Nullable username schema

Schema that accepts a unique username or `null`.

> By using a function as the `default_` parameter, the schema will return a unique username from the function call each time the input is `null`.

```ts
import { getUniqueUsername, isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const NullableUsernameSchema = v.nullableAsync(
  v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.nonEmpty(),
    v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique, "The username is not unique.")
  ),
  getUniqueUsername
);
```

##### Unwrap nullable schema

Use <Link href="../unwrap/">`unwrap`</Link> to undo the effect of `nullableAsync`.

```ts
import { isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const UsernameSchema = v.unwrap(
  // Assume this schema is from a different file and is reused here
  v.nullableAsync(
    v.pipeAsync(
      v.string(),
      v.nonEmpty(),
      v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique, "The username is not unique.")
    )
  )

- `TDefault` <Property {...properties.TDefault} />

#### Parameters

- `wrapped` <Property {...properties.wrapped} />
- `default_` {/_ prettier-ignore _/}<Property {...properties.default\_} />

##### Explanation

With `nullishAsync` the validation of your schema will pass `undefined` and `null` inputs, and if you specify a `default_` input value, the schema will use it if the input is `undefined` or `null`. For this reason, the output type may differ from the input type of the schema.

> Note that `nullishAsync` accepts `undefined` or `null` as an input. If you want to accept only `null` inputs, use <Link href="../nullableAsync/">`nullableAsync`</Link>, and if you want to accept only `undefined` inputs, use <Link href="../optionalAsync/">`optionalAsync`</Link> instead. Also, if you want to set a default output value for any invalid input, you should use <Link href="../fallbackAsync/">`fallbackAsync`</Link> instead.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `nullishAsync` can be used.

##### Nullish username schema

Schema that accepts a unique username, `undefined` or `null`.

> By using a function as the `default_` parameter, the schema will return a unique username from the function call each time the input is `undefined` or `null`.

```ts
import { getUniqueUsername, isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const NullishUsernameSchema = v.nullishAsync(
  v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.nonEmpty(),
    v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique, "The username is not unique.")

    v.email(),
    v.checkAsync(isEmailUnique, "The email is not unique.")
  ),
  username: v.nullishAsync(
    v.pipeAsync(
      v.string(),
      v.nonEmpty(),
      v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique, "The username is not unique.")
    )
  ),
  password: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(8)),
});

/*
  The input and output types of the schema:
    {
      email: string;
      password: string;
      username?: string | null | undefined;
    }
*/
```

##### Unwrap nullish schema

Use <Link href="../unwrap/">`unwrap`</Link> to undo the effect of `nullishAsync`.

```ts
import { isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const UsernameSchema = v.unwrap(
  // Assume this schema is from a different file and is reused here

> The difference to <Link href="../objectAsync/">`objectAsync`</Link> is that this schema includes unknown entries in the output. In addition, this schema filters certain entries from the unknown entries for security reasons.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `objectWithRestAsync` can be used. Please see the <Link href="/guides/objects/">object guide</Link> for more examples and explanations.

##### Word map schema

Schema to validate an object with word map mutation details.

```ts
import { isUserAllowedToMutate } from "~/api";

// Assume the rest of the keys are always English words

  {
    $userId: v.pipeAsync(
      v.string(),
      v.regex(/^[a-z0-9]{12}$/i),
      v.checkAsync(
        isUserAllowedToMutate,
        "The user is not allowed to change the word map."
      )
    ),
    $targetLanguage: v.union([

### optionalAsync

Creates an optional schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.optionalAsync<TWrapped, TDefault>(wrapped, default_);
```

#### Generics

- `TWrapped` <Property {...properties.TWrapped} />
- `TDefault` <Property {...properties.TDefault} />

#### Parameters

- `wrapped` <Property {...properties.wrapped} />
- `default_` {/_ prettier-ignore _/}<Property {...properties.default\_} />

##### Explanation

With `optionalAsync` the validation of your schema will pass `undefined` inputs, and if you specify a `default_` input value, the schema will use it if the input is `undefined`. For this reason, the output type may differ from the input type of the schema.

> Note that `optionalAsync` does not accept `null` as an input. If you want to accept `null` inputs, use <Link href="../nullableAsync/">`nullableAsync`</Link>, and if you want to accept `null` and `undefined` inputs, use <Link href="../nullishAsync/">`nullishAsync`</Link> instead. Also, if you want to set a default output value for any invalid input, you should use <Link href="../fallbackAsync/">`fallbackAsync`</Link> instead.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `optionalAsync` can be used.

##### Optional username schema

Schema that accepts a unique username or `undefined`.

> By using a function as the `default_` parameter, the schema will return a unique username from the function call each time the input is `undefined`.

```ts
import { getUniqueUsername, isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const OptionalUsernameSchema = v.optionalAsync(
  v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.nonEmpty(),
    v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique, "The username is not unique.")
  ),
  getUniqueUsername
);
```

##### New user schema

Schema to validate new user details.

```ts
import { isEmailUnique, isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const NewUserSchema = v.objectAsync({
  email: v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.email(),
    v.checkAsync(isEmailUnique, "The email is not unique.")
  ),
  username: v.optionalAsync(
    v.pipeAsync(
      v.string(),
      v.nonEmpty(),
      v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique, "The username is not unique.")
    )
  ),
  password: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(8)),
});

/*
  The input and output types of the schema:
    {
      email: string;
      password: string;
      username?: string | undefined;
    }
*/
```

##### Unwrap optional schema

Use <Link href="../unwrap/">`unwrap`</Link> to undo the effect of `optionalAsync`.

```ts
import { isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const UsernameSchema = v.unwrap(
  // Assume this schema is from a different file and is reused here
  v.optionalAsync(
    v.pipeAsync(
      v.string(),
      v.nonEmpty(),
      v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique, "The username is not unique.")
    )
  )
);
```

### parseAsync

Parses an unknown input based on a schema.

```ts
const output = v.parseAsync<TSchema>(schema, input, config);
```

#### Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />

#### Parameters

- `schema` <Property {...properties.schema} />
- `input` <Property {...properties.input} />
- `config` <Property {...properties.config} />

##### Explanation

`parseAsync` will throw a <Link href="../ValiError/">`ValiError`</Link> if the `input` does not match the `schema`. Therefore you should use a try/catch block to catch errors. If the input matches the schema, it is valid and the `output` of the schema will be returned typed.

> If an asynchronous operation associated with the passed schema throws an error, the promise returned by `parseAsync` is rejected and the error thrown may not be a <Link href="../ValiError/">`ValiError`</Link>.

#### Returns

- `output` <Property {...properties.output} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `parseAsync` can be used.

```ts
import { isEmailPresent } from "~/api";

try {
  const StoredEmailSchema = v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.email(),
    v.checkAsync(isEmailPresent, "The email is not in the database.")
  );
  const storedEmail = await v.parseAsync(StoredEmailSchema, "jane@example.com");

  // Handle errors if one occurs
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

### partialAsync

Creates a modified copy of an object schema that marks all or only the selected entries as optional.

```ts
const Schema = v.partialAsync<TSchema, TKeys>(schema, keys);
```

#### Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />
- `TKeys` <Property {...properties.TKeys} />

#### Parameters

- `schema` <Property {...properties.schema} />
- `keys` <Property {...properties.keys} />

##### Explanation

`partialAsync` creates a modified copy of the given object `schema` where all entries or only the selected `keys` are optional. It is similar to TypeScript's [`Partial`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#partialtype) utility type.

> Because `partialAsync` changes the data type of the input and output, it is not allowed to pass a schema that has been modified by the <Link href='../pipeAsync/'>`pipeAsync`</Link> method, as this may cause runtime errors. Please use the <Link href='../pipeAsync/'>`pipeAsync`</Link> method after you have modified the schema with `partialAsync`.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `partialAsync` can be used.

##### Update user schema

Schema to update the user details.

```ts
import { isEmailAbsent, isUsernameAbsent } from "~/api";

const UserSchema = v.objectAsync({
  email: v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.email(),
    v.checkAsync(isEmailAbsent, "The email is already in the database.")
  ),
  username: v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.nonEmpty(),
    v.checkAsync(isUsernameAbsent, "The username is already in the database.")
  ),
  password: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(8)),
});

const UpdateUserSchema = v.partialAsync(UserSchema);

/*
  { 
    email?: string;
    username?: string; 
    password?: string;
  }
*/
```

### partialCheckAsync

Creates a partial check validation action.

```ts
const Action = v.partialCheckAsync<TInput, TPaths, TSelection, TMessage>(
  paths,
  requirement,
  message
);
```

#### Generics

- `TInput` <Property {...properties.TInput} />
- `TPaths` <Property {...properties.TPaths} />
- `TSelection` <Property {...properties.TSelection} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `paths` <Property {...properties.paths} />
- `requirement` <Property {...properties.requirement} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `partialCheckAsync` you can freely validate the selected input and return `true` if it is valid or `false` otherwise. If the input does not match your `requirement`, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

> The difference to <Link href='../checkAsync/'>`checkAsync`</Link> is that `partialCheckAsync` can be executed whenever the selected part of the data is valid, while <Link href='../checkAsync/'>`checkAsync`</Link> is executed only when the entire dataset is typed. This can be an important advantage when working with forms.

#### Returns

- `Action` <Property {...properties.Action} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `partialCheckAsync` can be used.

##### Message details schema

Schema to validate details associated with a message.

```ts
import { isSenderInTheGroup } from "~/api";

const MessageDetailsSchema = v.pipeAsync(
  v.object({
    sender: v.object({
      name: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(2), v.maxLength(45)),
      email: v.pipe(v.string(), v.email()),
    }),
    groupId: v.pipe(v.string(), v.uuid()),
    message: v.pipe(v.string(), v.nonEmpty(), v.maxLength(500)),
  }),
  v.forwardAsync(
    v.partialCheckAsync(
      [["sender", "email"], ["groupId"]],
      (input) =>
        isSenderInTheGroup({
          senderEmail: input.sender.email,
          groupId: input.groupId,
        }),
      "The sender is not in the group."
    ),
    ["sender", "email"]
  )
);
```

### pipeAsync

Adds a pipeline to a schema, that can validate and transform its input.

```ts
const Schema = v.pipeAsync<TSchema, TItems>(schema, ...items);
```

#### Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />
- `TItems` <Property {...properties.TItems} />

#### Parameters

- `schema` <Property {...properties.schema} />
- `items` <Property {...properties.items} />

##### Explanation

`pipeAsync` creates a modified copy of the given `schema`, containing a pipeline for detailed validations and transformations. It passes the input data asynchronously through the `items` in the order they are provided and each item can examine and modify it.

> Since `pipeAsync` returns a schema that can be used as the first argument of another pipeline, it is possible to nest multiple `pipeAsync` calls to extend the validation and transformation further.

`pipeAsync` aborts early and marks the output as untyped if issues were collected before attempting to execute a schema or transformation action as the next item in the pipeline, to prevent unexpected behavior.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `pipeAsync` can be used. Please see the <Link href="/guides/pipelines/">pipeline guide</Link> for more examples and explanations.

##### Stored email schema

Schema to validate a stored email address.

```ts
import { isEmailPresent } from "~/api";

const StoredEmailSchema = v.pipeAsync(
  v.string(),
  v.nonEmpty("Please enter your email."),
  v.email("The email is badly formatted."),
  v.maxLength(30, "Your email is too long."),
  v.checkAsync(isEmailPresent, "The email is not in the database.")
);
```

##### New user schema

Schema to validate and transform new user details to a string.

```ts
import { isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const NewUserSchema = v.pipeAsync(
  v.objectAsync({
    firstName: v.pipe(v.string(), v.nonEmpty(), v.maxLength(30)),
    lastName: v.pipe(v.string(), v.nonEmpty(), v.maxLength(30)),
    username: v.pipeAsync(
      v.string(),
      v.nonEmpty(),
      v.maxLength(30),
      v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique, "The username is not unique.")
    ),
  }),
  v.transform(
    ({ firstName, lastName, username }) =>
      `${username} (${firstName} ${lastName})`
  )
);
```

### recordAsync

Creates a record schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.recordAsync<TKey, TValue, TMessage>(key, value, message);
```

#### Generics

- `TKey` <Property {...properties.TKey} />
- `TValue` <Property {...properties.TValue} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `key` <Property {...properties.key} />
- `value` <Property {...properties.value} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `recordAsync` you can validate the data type of the input and whether the entries match `key` and `value`. If the input is not an object, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

> This schema filters certain entries from the record for security reasons.

> This schema marks an entry as optional if it detects that its key is a literal type. The reason for this is that it is not technically possible to detect missing literal keys without restricting the `key` schema to <Link href="../string/">`string`</Link>, <Link href="../enum/">`enum`</Link> and <Link href="../picklist/">`picklist`</Link>. However, if <Link href="../enum/">`enum`</Link> and <Link href="../picklist/">`picklist`</Link> are used, it is better to use <Link href="../objectAsync/">`objectAsync`</Link> with <Link href="../entriesFromList/">`entriesFromList`</Link> because it already covers the needed functionality. This decision also reduces the bundle size of `recordAsync`, because it only needs to check the entries of the input and not any missing keys.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `recordAsync` can be used.

##### ID to email schema

Schema to validate a record that maps an ID to a public user email.

```ts
import { isEmailPublic } from "~/api";

const IdToEmailSchema = v.recordAsync(
  v.pipe(v.string(), v.uuid()),
  v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.email(),
    v.checkAsync(isEmailPublic, "The email address is private.")
  )
);
```

### requiredAsync

Creates a modified copy of an object schema that marks all or only the selected entries as required.

```ts
const AllKeysSchema = v.requiredAsync<TSchema, TMessage>(schema, message);
const SelectedKeysSchema = v.requiredAsync<TSchema, TKeys, TMessage>(
  schema,
  keys,
  message
);
```

#### Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />
- `TKeys` <Property {...properties.TKeys} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `schema` <Property {...properties.schema} />
- `keys` <Property {...properties.keys} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

`requiredAsync` creates a modified copy of the given object `schema` where all or only the selected `keys` are required. It is similar to TypeScript's [`Required`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#requiredtype) utility type.

> Because `requiredAsync` changes the data type of the input and output, it is not allowed to pass a schema that has been modified by the <Link href='../pipeAsync/'>`pipeAsync`</Link> method, as this may cause runtime errors. Please use the <Link href='../pipeAsync/'>`pipeAsync`</Link> method after you have modified the schema with `requiredAsync`.

#### Returns

- `AllKeysSchema` <Property {...properties.AllKeysSchema} />
- `SelectedKeysSchema` <Property {...properties.SelectedKeysSchema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `requiredAsync` can be used.

##### New task schema

Schema to validate an object containing task details.

```ts
import { isOwnerPresent } from "~/api";

const UpdateTaskSchema = v.objectAsync({
  owner: v.optionalAsync(
    v.pipeAsync(
      v.string(),
      v.email(),
      v.checkAsync(isOwnerPresent, "The owner is not in the database.")
    )
  ),
  title: v.optional(v.pipe(v.string(), v.nonEmpty(), v.maxLength(255))),
  description: v.optional(v.pipe(v.string(), v.nonEmpty())),
});

const NewTaskSchema = v.requiredAsync(UpdateTaskSchema);

/*
  {
    owner: string;
    title: string;
    description: string;
  }
*/
```

### strictObjectAsync

Creates a strict object schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.strictObjectAsync<TEntries, TMessage>(entries, message);
```

#### Generics

- `TEntries` <Property {...properties.TEntries} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `entries` <Property {...properties.entries} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `strictObjectAsync` you can validate the data type of the input and whether the content matches `entries`. If the input is not an object or does include unknown entries, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

> The difference to <Link href="../objectAsync/">`objectAsync`</Link> is that this schema returns an issue for unknown entries. It intentionally returns only one issue. Otherwise, attackers could send large objects to exhaust device resources. If you want an issue for every unknown key, use the <Link href="../objectWithRestAsync/">`objectWithRestAsync`</Link> schema with <Link href="../never/">`never`</Link> for the `rest` argument.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `strictObjectAsync` can be used. Please see the <Link href="/guides/objects/">object guide</Link> for more examples and explanations.

##### New user schema

Schema to validate a strict object containing only specific new user details.

```ts
import { isEmailPresent } from "~/api";

const NewUserSchema = v.strictObjectAsync({
  firstName: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(2), v.maxLength(45)),
  lastName: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(2), v.maxLength(45)),
  email: v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.email(),
    v.checkAsync(isEmailPresent, "The email is already in use by another user.")
  ),
  password: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(8)),
  avatar: v.optional(v.pipe(v.string(), v.url())),
});

### undefinedableAsync

Creates an undefinedable schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.undefinedableAsync<TWrapped, TDefault>(wrapped, default_);
```

#### Generics

- `TWrapped` <Property {...properties.TWrapped} />
- `TDefault` <Property {...properties.TDefault} />

#### Parameters

- `wrapped` <Property {...properties.wrapped} />
- `default_` {/_ prettier-ignore _/}<Property {...properties.default\_} />

##### Explanation

With `undefinedableAsync` the validation of your schema will pass `undefined` inputs, and if you specify a `default_` input value, the schema will use it if the input is `undefined`. For this reason, the output type may differ from the input type of the schema.

> `undefinedableAsync` behaves exactly the same as <Link href="../optionalAsync/">`optionalAsync`</Link> at runtime. The only difference is the input and output type when used for object entries. While <Link href="../optionalAsync/">`optionalAsync`</Link> adds a question mark to the key, `undefinedableAsync` does not.

> Note that `undefinedableAsync` does not accept `null` as an input. If you want to accept `null` inputs, use <Link href="../nullableAsync/">`nullableAsync`</Link>, and if you want to accept `null` and `undefined` inputs, use <Link href="../nullishAsync/">`nullishAsync`</Link> instead. Also, if you want to set a default output value for any invalid input, you should use <Link href="../fallbackAsync/">`fallbackAsync`</Link> instead.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `undefinedableAsync` can be used.

##### Undefinedable username schema

Schema that accepts a unique username or `undefined`.

> By using a function as the `default_` parameter, the schema will return a unique username from the function call each time the input is `undefined`.

```ts
import { getUniqueUsername, isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const UndefinedableUsernameSchema = v.undefinedableAsync(
  v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.nonEmpty(),
    v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique, "The username is not unique.")
  ),
  getUniqueUsername
);
```

##### New user schema

Schema to validate new user details.

```ts
import { isEmailUnique, isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const NewUserSchema = v.objectAsync({
  email: v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.email(),
    v.checkAsync(isEmailUnique, "The email is not unique.")
  ),
  username: v.undefinedableAsync(
    v.pipeAsync(
      v.string(),
      v.nonEmpty(),
      v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique, "The username is not unique.")
    )
  ),
  password: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(8)),
});

/*
  The input and output types of the schema:
    {
      email: string;
      password: string;
      username: string | undefined;
    }
*/
```

##### Unwrap undefinedable schema

Use <Link href="../unwrap/">`unwrap`</Link> to undo the effect of `undefinedableAsync`.

```ts
import { isUsernameUnique } from "~/api";

const UsernameSchema = v.unwrap(
  // Assume this schema is from a different file and is reused here
  v.undefinedableAsync(
    v.pipeAsync(
      v.string(),
      v.nonEmpty(),
      v.checkAsync(isUsernameUnique, "The username is not unique.")
    )
  )

### unionAsync

Creates an union schema.

> I recommend that you read the <Link href="/guides/unions/">unions guide</Link> before using this schema function.

```ts
const Schema = v.unionAsync<TOptions, TMessage>(options, message);
```

#### Generics

- `TOptions` <Property {...properties.TOptions} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `options` <Property {...properties.options} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `unionAsync` you can validate if the input matches one of the given `options`. If the input does not match a schema and cannot be clearly assigned to one of the options, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

If a bad input can be uniquely assigned to one of the schemas based on the data type, the result of that schema is returned. Otherwise, a general issue is returned that contains the issues of each schema as subissues. This is a special case within the library, as the issues of `unionAsync` can contradict each other.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `unionAsync` can be used.

const UserSchema = v.unionAsync([
  v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.email(),
    v.checkAsync(isEmailPresent, "The email is not in the database.")
  ),
  v.pipeAsync(
    v.string(),
    v.nonEmpty(),
    v.checkAsync(isUsernamePresent, "The username is not in the database.")
  ),

### variantAsync

Creates a variant schema.

```ts
const Schema = v.variantAsync<TKey, TOptions, TMessage>(key, options, message);
```

#### Generics

- `TKey` <Property {...properties.TKey} />
- `TOptions` <Property {...properties.TOptions} />
- `TMessage` <Property {...properties.TMessage} />

#### Parameters

- `key` <Property {...properties.key} />
- `options` <Property {...properties.options} />
- `message` <Property {...properties.message} />

##### Explanation

With `variantAsync` you can validate if the input matches one of the given object `options`. The object schema to be used for the validation is determined by the discriminator `key`. If the input does not match a schema and cannot be clearly assigned to one of the options, you can use `message` to customize the error message.

> It is allowed to specify the exact same or a similar discriminator multiple times. However, in such cases `variantAsync` will only return the output of the first untyped or typed variant option result. Typed results take precedence over untyped ones.

> For deeply nested `variant` schemas with several different discriminator keys, `variant` will return an issue for the first most likely object schemas on invalid input. The order of the discriminator keys and the presence of a discriminator in the input are taken into account.

#### Returns

- `Schema` <Property {...properties.Schema} />

#### Examples

The following examples show how `variantAsync` can be used.

##### Message schema

Schema to validate a message object.

```ts
import { isValidGroupReceiver, isValidUserReceiver } from "~/api";

const MessageSchema = v.objectAsync({
  message: v.pipe(v.string(), v.nonEmpty()),
  receiver: v.variantAsync("type", [
    v.objectAsync({
      type: v.literal("group"),
      groupId: v.pipeAsync(
        v.string(),
        v.uuid(),
        v.checkAsync(isValidGroupReceiver, "The group cannot receive messages.")
      ),
    }),
    v.objectAsync({
      type: v.literal("user"),
      email: v.pipeAsync(
        v.string(),
        v.email(),
        v.checkAsync(isValidUserReceiver, "The user cannot receive messages.")
      ),
    }),
  ]),
});
```

##### User schema

Schema to validate unique user details.

```ts
import { isRegisteredEmail, isRegisteredUsername, isValidUserId } from "~/api";

const UserSchema = v.variantAsync("type", [
  // Assume this schema is from a different file and reused here.
  v.variantAsync("type", [
    v.objectAsync({
      type: v.literal("email"),
      email: v.pipeAsync(
        v.string(),
        v.email(),
        v.checkAsync(isRegisteredEmail, "The email is not registered.")
      ),
    }),
    v.objectAsync({
      type: v.literal("username"),
      username: v.pipeAsync(
        v.string(),
        v.nonEmpty(),
        v.checkAsync(isRegisteredUsername, "The username is not registered.")
      ),
    }),
  ]),
  v.objectAsync({
    type: v.literal("userId"),
    userId: v.pipeAsync(
      v.string(),
      v.uuid(),
      v.checkAsync(isValidUserId, "The user id is not valid.")
    ),
  }),
]);
